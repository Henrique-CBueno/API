Abstract  
The Global EV Outlook is an annual publication that reports on recent 
developments in electric mobility around the world. It is developed with the support 
of members of the Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI). 
The report draws on the latest data to assess trends in electric vehicle deployment, 
demand for their batteries and charging infrastructure. It considers recent policy 
developments and industry strategies shaping the outlook for electric vehicles in 
different markets. This edition features analysis of electric vehicle affordability, 
manufacturing and trade of electric cars and their batteries, and the total cost of 
ownership of electric heavy-duty trucks across various markets, and makes 
projections to 2030. 
The report is complemented by updated versions of two online tools: the Global 
EV Data Explorer and the Global EV Policy Explorer, which allow users to further 
explore EV statistics and projections, and policy measures worldwide.

Electric Vehicles Initiative 
The Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI) is a multi-governmental policy forum 
established in 2010 under the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM). Recognising the 
opportunities offered by EVs, the EVI is dedicated to accelerating the adoption of 
EVs worldwide. To do so, it strives to better understand the policy challenges 
related to electric mobility, to help governments address them and to serve as a 
platform for knowledge-sharing among government policy makers. The EVI also 
facilitates exchanges between government policy makers and a variety of other 
partners on topics important for the transition to electric mobility, such as charging 
infrastructure and grid integration as well as EV battery supply chains.   
The International Energy Agency serves as the co-ordinator of the initiative. 
Governments that have been active in the EVI in the 2024-25 period include 
Canada, Chile, People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”), Finland, France, 
Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, 
Sweden, United Kingdom and United States.  
The Global EV Outlook annual series is the flagship publication of the EVI. It is 
dedicated to tracking and monitoring the progress of electric mobility worldwide 
and to informing policy makers on how to best accelerate electrification of the road 
transport sector.

Executive summary

Executive summary 
Electric car sales continue to break records globally, 
particularly in China and other emerging economies  
Electric car sales exceeded 17 million globally in 2024, reaching a sales 
share of more than 20%. Just the additional 3.5 million electric cars sold in 2024 
compared with the previous year is more than the total number of electric cars 
sold worldwide in 2020. China maintained its lead, with electric cars accounting 
for almost half of all car sales in 2024; the over 11 million electric cars sold in 
China last year were more than global sales just 2 years earlier. As a result of 
continued strong growth, 1 in 10 cars on Chinese roads is now electric. Europe 
saw sales stagnate in 2024 as subsidy schemes and other supportive policies 
waned, but the sales share of electric cars remained around 20% as stronger sales 
in some countries compensated for lower sales in others. In the United States, 
electric car sales grew by about 10% year-on-year, reaching more than 1 in 10 
cars sold.  
Emerging markets in Asia and Latin America are becoming new centres of 
growth, with electric car sales jumping by over 60% in 2024 to almost 
600 000 – about the size of the European market 5 years earlier. In Southeast 
Asia, electric car sales grew by nearly 50% to represent 9% of all car sales in the 
region, with notably higher sales shares in Thailand and Viet Nam. In Brazil, the 
largest car market in Latin America, electric car sales more than doubled to 
125 000 in 2024, reaching a sales share of over 6%. Sales in Africa also more 
than doubled, too, mostly thanks to growing sales in Egypt and Morocco, though 
electric cars still represent less than 1% of total car sales across the continent. 
Policy support and relatively affordable electric car imports from China played a 
central role in increasing sales in some emerging electric vehicle (EV) markets, 
accounting for 85% of electric car sales in both Brazil and Thailand, for example. 
Across all emerging economies outside of China, Chinese imports made up 75% 
of the increase in electric car sales in 2024.  
Expected growth in electric car sales is led by China and 
Europe, alongside a surge in emerging economies  
Electric car sales in 2025 are expected to exceed 20 million worldwide to 
represent more than one-quarter of cars sold worldwide. Sales were up 35% 
year-on-year in the first three months of 2025, with record first-quarter sales in all 
major markets. In China, the continuation of incentives for replacing older vehicles 
and falling electric car prices mean electric cars are projected to reach around 


Global EV Outlook 2025 
Executive summary

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
60% of total car sales in the country in 2025. Emissions standards in the 
European Union and the United Kingdom will require higher shares of zero-
emission car sales in 2025. Building on more than 20% year-on-year sales growth 
observed in the first quarter, these policy pushes are expected to drive up electric 
car sales in Europe in 2025 to reach a sales share of 25%, despite flexibility given 
to automakers for meeting the 2025 EU emissions reduction target. While the 2025 
outlook for electric car sales in the United States is uncertain based on today’s 
policy direction, sales are currently expected to maintain the 10% growth observed 
in the first quarter; as consumers take advantage of existing tax credits in view of 
their potential repeal, electric car sales are projected to reach 11% of total car 
sales over the full year. In emerging economies other than China, sales are 
expected to continue growing strongly, increasing by 50% to reach 1 million in 
2025. 
Despite uncertainties in the outlook, the share of electric cars in overall car 
sales is set to exceed 40% in 2030 under today’s policy settings. China is 
poised to continue leading in electric car sales to 2030, achieving a sales share of 
around 80% on the back of significant market momentum and competitively-priced 
EVs. In Europe, carbon dioxide (CO2) targets support the achievement of a sales 
share of close to 60% by 2030, slightly below last year’s projection. The sales 
share in the United States grows much more modestly than in our Outlook last 
year, reaching around 20% by 2030 based on today’s policy direction – less than 
half the share projected for 2030 last year. In Southeast Asia, meanwhile, electric 
car sales are boosted by strong policy support and available domestic 
manufacturing capacity: by 2030, one in four cars sold in the region is poised to 
be electric. Two/three-wheelers – an important mode of road transport in the 
region – electrify faster: by 2030, almost 1 in 3 such vehicles sold are electric. 
Across all vehicle modes, the deployment of EVs replaces the use of more than 5 
million barrels of oil per day globally in 2030, an important energy security 
consideration. Half of these savings are the result of EV adoption in China.  
Uncertainty about the evolution of trade and industrial policy, downside 
risks to the economic outlook, and lower oil prices could affect EV uptake – 
but also car markets overall. Higher tariffs might increase the price of cars, 
including electric cars, and their components; lower GDP growth could dampen 
car sales; and lower oil prices affect the fuel cost savings from the use of electric 
cars. The way these factors will play out in practice is uncertain, but on aggregate 
they look to pose risks for overall car sales volumes more than for the share of 
EVs. In China, continued political support and competitive EV prices suggest that 
EV sales can withstand such headwinds. In Europe, where price differentials with 
conventional cars are larger, the combination of longer-term policy ambition and 
examples of policy responses from the pandemic suggest that sustaining EV sales 
is possible. Low oil prices can reduce fuel savings offered by battery electric cars, 
but even at global benchmark oil prices of USD 40 per barrel, there would be

significant fuel cost savings in all major EV markets when charging at home. In 
China, public fast charging costs around twice as much as home charging, but it 
would still offer savings for EV owners compared with driving a conventional car.  
Global trade of electric cars is growing as manufacturers 
eye new markets 
China continues to be the world’s EV manufacturing hub and is responsible 
for more than 70% of global production. Car manufacturers headquarted in 
China predominantly cater to the domestic market, accounting for around 80% of 
domestic sales in 2024 and almost all of the 25% growth in global EV production. 
In the European Union, production stalled at 2.4 million electric cars in 2024. North 
America saw contrasting trends: US production declined whereas Mexico’s output 
doubled, supported by comparatively low manufacturing costs. Roughly 70% of 
Mexico’s output was from US-headquartered manufacturers. Production also 
increased by 15% in Asia Pacific countries other than China, reaching about 
1 million electric cars, mostly from incumbent carmakers from Japan and Korea.  
Global trade of electric cars increased 20% in 2024; imports now represent 
almost one-fifth of global electric car sales. At 40% (nearly 1.25 million electric 
cars), China accounted for the largest share of global exports in 2024. The 
European Union also remained a net exporter of electric cars: exports reached 
over 800 000, mostly destined for other European countries (such as the United 
Kingdom) and North America. EU imports were below 700 000, of which 60% 
came from China. The United States remained a net importer of electric cars; 
imports increased by nearly 40% in 2024, while exports fell by nearly 15%.  
Chinese EV export markets are diversifying as Chinese automakers make 
headway in Brazil, Mexico and Southeast Asia. Several potential markets for 
Chinese EV exports have recently adopted or are considering the use of tariffs. 
This has prompted Chinese manufacturers to either frontload their exports before 
such tariffs come into force (as in Brazil) or to seek new markets for their available 
output. Today, overseas manufacturing capacity from Chinese manufacturers 
supplies about 5% of electric car sales in emerging markets and is set to grow 
further.  
Competition and declining battery prices are improving 
affordability, though progress is uneven  
As a global average, the price of battery electric cars fell in 2024, but the 
purchase price gap with conventional cars persisted in many markets. The 
average battery electric car price in Germany, for example, remained 20% higher 
than that of its conventional counterpart. In the United States, battery electric cars 
remained 30% more expensive, dampening future sales growth expectations. In 


Global EV Outlook 2025 
Executive summary

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
contrast, two-thirds of all electric cars sold in China in 2024 were priced lower than 
their conventional equivalents, without considering purchase incentives for EVs. 
This helped boost sales even as government incentives decreased.  
Chinese electric car models are typically cheaper than the average EV in 
emerging markets, bolstering the competitive position of the Chinese 
industry. In Thailand, the average price of a battery electric car has now reached 
parity with an average conventional car, and the Chinese electric cars available 
are, on average, even cheaper. In Brazil, the price gap between battery electric 
cars and conventional cars shrank to 25% in 2024 from over 100% in 2023 as 
Chinese electric car imports grew to 85% of the country’s EV sales. Similarly, the 
average price premium of battery electric cars in Mexico fell to 50% in 2024 from 
more than 100% in 2023 as Chinese imports reached two-thirds of sales.  
Low critical mineral prices and increasing competition between battery 
manufacturers drove down battery pack prices in all markets in 2024, albeit 
with significant variations. In China, prices fell by about 30%, compared with 
10-15% in Europe and the United States. The faster pace of cost reductions in 
China – enabled by strong competition, increasing manufacturing efficiency and 
supply chain integration, and access to a skilled workforce – is increasing the 
competitive advantage of Chinese battery manufacturers. 
Improving charging coverage, capacity and integration is 
key to growing adoption of electric vehicles 
Public charging stations have doubled in the past 2 years to keep up with 
growing EV sales. China and the European Union have maintained a steady 
pace of charger deployment compared with the number of EVs on the road. 
However, in both the United States and United Kingdom, which have higher rates 
of access to home chargers than China, public charger build-out has not kept pace 
with EV deployment, and the number of electric light-duty vehicles per public 
charging point increased in 2024.  
Charging capacity is an important measure of the adequacy of public 
charging networks. The number of ultra-fast chargers, with power ratings of 
150 kilowatts (kW) and above, grew by about 50% in 2024 and now account for 
nearly 10% of all public fast chargers. Public slow chargers in urban areas are a 
solution for EV owners without access to home charging, but fast chargers along 
highways help enable long-distance trips. In Europe, over three-quarters of all 
highways have a fast-charging station at least every 50 kilometres, compared with 
less than half of US highways. Globally, public charging capacity for light-duty EVs 
would need to grow by almost ninefold to 2030 to support EV sales implied by 
stated policies. Even so, EVs are set to account for only 2.5% of total global 
electricity demand in 2030. 


Global EV Outlook 2025 
Executive summary

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Government efforts to promote interoperability, standardisation, smart 
charging and vehicle-to-grid integration can ease the transition to EVs for 
drivers and grid operators. Technologies such as smart chargers and vehicle-
to-grid-capable EV models are becoming more available, but new market 
structures and legal frameworks will be needed for vehicles to maximise the 
potential benefits for the grid. China and the United Kingdom stand out for policy 
implementation and demonstration projects in this area. Battery technology 
innovations in recent years are also enabling safe high-power charging that could 
be as quick as refuelling a conventional car, but fully realising these advances 
hinges on deploying adequate infrastructure. 
The value proposition for electric trucks is improving, 
even for long-haul operations 
Electric truck sales grew by nearly 80% globally in 2024 to reach close to 2% 
of total truck sales. Spurred by a new scrappage scheme for conventional trucks, 
China’s electric truck sales doubled to 75 000 vehicles, representing over 80% of 
global sales in 2024. In Europe and the United States, electric truck sales in 2024 
remained similar to 2023 levels. The number of battery electric truck models 
available has grown from less than 70 in 2020 to more than 400, increasing the 
number of applications that can be met by electric trucks. 
The total cost of ownership of a battery electric heavy-duty truck is already 
lower than for a diesel equivalent in China in certain cases. The purchase 
price of battery electric heavy-duty trucks remains two to three times higher than 
equivalent diesel trucks in major markets, which can discourage fleet operators, 
who often operate under tight margins. However, greater efficiency and lower 
energy costs – even including the cost of a high-power charger – make battery 
electric trucks more attractive the more they are used. By 2030, battery electric 
trucks in Europe and the United States are expected to reach parity on the total 
cost of ownership with diesel trucks for long-haul operations, as they already have 
in China, and are set to remain more cost-effective than hydrogen fuel cell trucks. 
However, the specific application and use profile of trucks are key factors for 
determining which powertrain technology is most suitable, meaning case-by-case 
analysis may be needed to evaluate the costs of various alternatives.  
Mandated rest periods for truck drivers can play an important role in 
reducing the opportunity cost of charging en route. For long-haul trucking, the 
wait time for recharging an electric truck can pose difficulties for logistics 
operators. However, the 45-minute rest period mandated in the European Union 
can accommodate the addition of around 150 km of driving range for a heavy-duty 
truck using a 350 kW charger, and up to about 400 km if a megawatt charger is 
used. While the United States and China also have mandated rest periods, the 
design of the EU policy is currently most conducive to supporting EV adoption.

1. Trends in electric car markets 
Electric car sales 
Global electric car sales exceeded 17 million in 2024 
More than 20% of new cars sold worldwide were electric 
Electric car sales topped 17 million worldwide in 2024, rising by more than 25%.1 
Just the additional 3.5 million cars sold in 2024 compared to 2023 outnumber total 
electric car sales in the whole of 2020. China maintained its lead among major 
markets, with electric car sales exceeding 11 million – more than were sold 
worldwide just 2 years earlier. Global sales were slightly tempered by stagnating 
growth in Europe, as subsidies were phased out or reduced in several major 
markets, and as the EU CO2 targets for cars remained the same between 2023 
and 2024. Electric car sales continued to increase in the United States although 
growth was about one-quarter that of the previous year. Significantly, outside of 
these three major markets, there was a record increase in sales of nearly 40% to 
reach 1.3 million, closing in on the United States’ sales of 1.6 million electric cars.

The rapid growth in electric car sales over the past 5 years has had a significant 
impact on the global car fleet: At the end of 2024, the electric car fleet had reached 
almost 58 million, about 4% of the total passenger car fleet and more than triple 
the total electric car fleet in 2021. Notably, the global stock of electric cars 
displaced over 1 million barrels per day of oil consumption in 2024. Of course, the 
stock of electric cars is not spread evenly across the world – in China, for example, 
around one in ten cars on the road is now electric, whereas in Europe the ratio is 
closer to one in twenty.  
Almost half of China’s car sales were electric in 2024, 
representing almost two-thirds of electric cars sold globally  
Electric car sales in China increased by almost 40% year-on-year in 2024, further 
driving up China’s share of global electric car sales. In 2021, China accounted for 
half of global electric car sales; this share grew to almost two-thirds in 2024. On a 
monthly basis, sales of electric cars have overtaken conventional car sales in the 
country since July 2024, bringing the share of electric car sales close to 50% for 
the full year. In China, 2024 marks the fourth consecutive year in which the electric 
car sales share grew by approximately 10 percentage points year-on-year.  
The growth in China reflects in no small part the growing price competitiveness of 
battery electric cars with conventional cars in the country. In addition, China’s 
electric car market benefitted from the introduction of a trade-in scheme in April 
2024. The scheme, which is part of a wider economic stimulus package, applies 
to the purchase of conventional and electric cars alike, but with different levels of 
financial support. It offers CNY 20 000 (Yuan renminbi) (USD 2 750) for 
consumers that replace an older vehicle (conventional or electric) with a new 
electric car, and CNY 15 000 (USD 2 050) for replacement with a new 
conventional vehicle. In 2024, about 6.6 million consumers applied for the 
incentive, 60% of whom bought an electric car. As such, more than one-third of 
the over 11 million new electric car sales in the country benefitted from this 
incentive.  
In recent years, sales of plug-in hybrid electric cars have been growing faster than 
sales of battery electric cars in China. The share of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle 
(PHEV) sales, excluding extended-range EVs (EREVs)2, in China’s total electric 
car sales has risen from about 15% in 2020 to nearly 30% in 2024. Meanwhile, 
the share of EREVs has more than quadrupled since 2020, surpassing 10% in 
 
 
2 If not otherwise specified, PHEVs includes EREVs. Extended-range EVs are a subset of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles that 
have both an internal combustion engine (ICE) and a plug-in rechargeable battery. Throughout this report, EREVs refer to 
plug-in series hybrid powertrain configurations where the ICE only operates without direct mechanical connection to the 
wheels to recharge the battery through an electric generator. Other plug-in hybrid configurations (such as parallel and series-
parallel configurations) fall under the “standard” PHEV category. EREVs generally feature larger battery and longer electric 
range than standard PHEVs.

2024. The acceleration of PHEV sales in China led the share of electric car sales 
that are battery electric to fall from 80% in 2020 to below 60% in 2024, though in 
absolute terms battery electric car sales increased sevenfold over the same 
period, demonstrating their continued appeal to new customers. 
In Europe, electric car sales stagnated in 2024 as policy 
support waned in major car markets  
About one in five new cars sold on the European market was electric in 2024, 
maintaining the sales share of the previous year. The electric sales share 
increased in 2024 in 14 out of 27 EU member states, while it either stalled or 
decreased in the rest, including in several larger markets, such as Germany and 
France, largely as a result of subsidies being phased out or reduced. In Germany, 
subsidies ceased at the end of 2023, while France has progressively reduced its 
subsidy over the years. At the start of 2024, France limited the amount of 
environmental bonus available to higher-income car buyers and reduced the 
number of vehicles eligible for the subsidy.  
Besides subsidies, the policy design of the European Union CO2 standards may 
also have held back further growth of the electric car market in 2024. As new 
targets come into effect every 5 years, car makers had no incentive to push sales 
of electric cars further in 2024 (in anticipation of strengthened targets in 2025). 
This is in contrast to markets such as the United Kingdom, where annually 
increasing targets move original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) towards 
electrification each year. In March 2025, the European Commission published its 
Industrial Action Plan for the European automotive sector, in which it proposed to 
amend the CO2 emission performance standards for cars and vans, granting them 
additional flexibilities by averaging their performance over a 3-year period. 
In the United Kingdom – the second-largest car market in Europe – electric car 
sales reached a share of nearly 30%, up from 24% in 2023. The year 2024 was 
the first under the Vehicle Emissions Trading Scheme, which required 22% of all 
new registrations to be BEV or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). When accounting 
for the scheme’s flexibilities, which allows OEMs to borrow credits from future 
years, they were able to comply with a battery electric car sales share of close to 
20%. Norway reached near-total electrification of sales, with 88% of car sales 
being battery electric and just under 3% plug-in hybrid. As a result of the growing 
stock of electric cars, Norway’s oil consumption for road in 2024 decreased by 
12% compared to 2021. From April 2025, a tax increase on conventional internal 
combustion engine (ICE) cars and PHEVs is expected to further increase the 
battery electric share towards meeting the Norwegian government’s 2025 goal of 
100% zero-emissions car sales. In Denmark, the electric sales share increased 
by 10 percentage points to reach 56%, with nearly 100 000 electric cars sold.

The market share of electric cars continued to expand in the 
United States 
In the United States, electric car sales increased to 1.6 million in 2024, with the 
sales share growing to more than 10%. However, growth in electric car sales 
slowed down significantly in 2024, increasing by just 10% compared to 40% in 
2023. In spite of this, electric car sales did boost the overall car market, as sales 
of conventional cars stagnated.  
A total of 24 new electric car models were launched in 2024, increasing model 
availability by 15% compared to 2023, providing consumers with more choices 
and further increasing competition. While the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 have 
been the two best-selling models in the United States since 2020, the 110 new 
models that have entered the market since then have driven the market share of 
Tesla down from 60% in 2020 to 38% in 2024. Furthermore, 2024 was the first 
year in which Tesla saw a drop in sales in the United States, while other OEMs 
saw sales increase by 20% on aggregate. 
A modification to the US Clean Vehicle Tax Credit at the start of 2024 enabled 
buyers to receive an instant discount (up to USD 7 500 for a new electric car and 
USD 4 000 for a used electric car) at the point of sale, which may have served to 
entice interested buyers. However, not all electric cars were eligible for the credit: 
in 2024 about 20 electric models (not accounting for different trim levels) out of a 
total 110 were eligible, which translated to over half of US electric car sales. The 
real share that benefitted from the tax credit may be even higher. In 2023, 
provisions were introduced on leased electric cars to reclassify them as 
commercial vehicles, thereby making them eligible for the tax credit without having 
to meet requirements on local manufacturing. As a result, by 2024, nearly half of 
all EVs sold were leased, more than double the share seen 3 years earlier. In 
addition to the federal tax credit, in 2024, 27 states offered additional incentives, 
rebates and exemptions promoting electric car adoption.

Emerging markets saw a strong uptick in electric car 
sales  
Electric car sales shares doubled in a number of emerging 
markets 
In emerging and developing economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa, electric 
car sales increased by over 60% year-on-year in 2024, and the sales share almost 
doubled from 2.5% to 4%. This rapid growth has been strengthened by policy 
incentives and the growing presence of relatively affordable electric cars from 
Chinese OEMs.  
Emerging and developing economies in Asia (excluding China) saw a large 
increase in electric car sales, reaching almost 400 000 in 2024, up over 40% from 
2023. However, in India, total electric car sales and their share of sales increased 
only slightly, approaching 100 000 (or 2%) in 2024. Thailand remained the largest 
EV market in Southeast Asia, despite a 10% drop in electric car sales. This decline 
was outweighed by an even steeper 26% drop in conventional car sales, largely 
due to stricter lending criteria, meaning the electric sales share rose to 13% in 
2024, up from 11% the previous year. Within the region, Indonesia and Viet Nam 
also stood out, respectively tripling and nearly doubling their sales numbers and 
reaching sales shares comparable to countries such as Spain or Canada. In many 
Southeast Asian countries, BEVs are the most popular electric car type, with over 
90% of all electric car sales being fully electric.  
In Latin America, sales volumes and penetration rates doubled in many countries, 
with electric cars reaching a market share of 4% in 2024. Brazil towered over other 
countries in the region with nearly 125 000 electric car sales, more than twice the 
number of 2023 sales, and the electric sales share doubled to 6.5%. Costa Rica, 
Uruguay and Colombia also achieved impressive sales shares of around 15%, 
13% and 7.5%, respectively. These increases are in large part the result of 
government incentives such as tax exemptions, reduced registration fees, a 
relaxation of traffic restrictions for EVs, and relatively high fossil fuel prices. 
In Africa, electric car sales more than doubled to reach nearly 11 000 in 2024. 
Sales shares remained low, at under 1%, though there was growth in several 
countries, such as Morocco and Egypt, where new electric car sales increased to 
more than 2 000.

helping to drive up sales. In Viet Nam, local brands underpinned the near doubling 
of the electric sales share in 2024 to reach 17%. VinFast has also started to export 
to 11 different countries, with the largest share of exports going to Southeast Asian 
countries such as Indonesia (44%) and Malaysia (22%), but also to the 
United States (22%). The company has announced plans to double domestic 
production in Viet Nam, as well as expanding manufacturing into India and 
Indonesia. 
Türkiye continues to deploy the domestically produced Togg electric cars, 
increasing its total production by 50% year-on-year. The increase in domestic 
production and in imports resulted in the country reaching an electric sales share 
of 10% in 2024. In July 2024, the Turkish government announced a USD 5 billion 
package to boost its annual production to 1 million electric cars per year. 
India’s electric car market is predominantly supplied by Indian OEM Tata. In 
addition, at the end of 2023, Indian steelmaker JSW signed a joint venture with 
SAIC Motor, a Chinese OEM, to work together on car production under the name 
MG Motor. In 2024, the joint venture produced about half of its electric cars sold 
in India domestically, while the other half were imported from China. At the end of 
2024, JSW also announced the launch of its own EV brand, and is in talks with 
partners such as BYD and Geely regarding collaboration on technology transfer.

Overseas expansion plans of Chinese producers, prompted by 
changes to import tariffs, drove sales in emerging markets 
Another notable trend from 2024 was the numerous manufacturing 
announcements from Chinese OEMs in countries such as Brazil, Thailand, 
Indonesia and Malaysia, where temporary exemptions from import tariffs for 
electric cars are coming to an end. In 2024, electric car sales in Brazil more than 
doubled, with over 85% of new electric cars coming from China. A key factor 
behind this impressive growth was electric cars being exempt from import duties 
of 35%, though this exemption started to be gradually removed in 2024 and is set 
to end by the middle of 2026. By then, automakers BYD and GWM will have begun 
producing models in Brazil, with a range tailored to the Brazilian market, such as 
BYD’s Song Pro, which will be flex-fuel compatible.     
In Thailand, Chinese imports play a key role in electrification, accounting for 85% 
of electric car sales. However, as in Brazil, this share is expected to decline due 
to changes introduced in the EV 3.5 program, under which import taxes on electric 
cars will be reintroduced at the end of 2025 and existing subsidies of up to 
THB 100 000 (Thai baht) (USD 2 800) per imported car will be gradually phased 
out. To continue to qualify for the exemption and subsidy, OEMs must commit to 
producing at least two battery electric vehicles (BEVs) domestically by the end of 
2026 for every imported BEV sold in 2024 and 2025.  
In Indonesia, electric car sales tripled in 2024 while the conventional market 
contracted by 20%, leading to an electric sales share of over 7%. The government 
has supported adoption by reducing the VAT rate on electric cars from 11% to 1% 
since 2023. However, what has potentially had an even greater impact on reducing 
the cost of electric cars for Indonesian buyers – and thus stimulating EV sales – 
has been the government waiving import taxes for EVs from car makers that invest 
in local electric car manufacturing from the start of 2024. Chinese car 
manufactures such as BYD and GAC Aion profited from this reduction, as did 
European OEM Stellantis. As a result, Chinese electric car imports increased 18-
fold to 34 000 by the end of 2024. 
In Malaysia, electric car sales more than doubled in 2024 and the sales share 
increased from less than 2% in 2023 to nearly 4% in 2024. Much of this success 
is due to imported electric cars being exempt from import taxes and excise duties 
until the end of 2025. Ahead of the tax exemption ending, Chinese car producer 
Geely, together with Proton (a Malaysian automotive company), will start 
domestically producing the e.MAS 7 by the end of 2025, backed by an investment 
from Geely. Malaysian OEM Perodua will also start producing its first electric car 
at the end of 2025, with a price of RM 80 000 (Malaysia ringgit) (USD 18 000).

More affordable electric cars and local policies have reshaped 
the EV landscape in more emerging markets 
Policy measures such as tax incentives for electric cars contributed to the doubling 
of electric car sales seen in Colombia and Costa Rica in 2024. Colombia also 
proposed to increase import tariffs on all hybrid vehicles at the end of 2024, in a 
push to shift more sales towards BEVs. More than 70% of all electric cars sold in 
these two countries were imported from China, with Chinese imports to Colombia 
more than tripling in 2024, while imports from other countries grew by just 30%. In 
Uzbekistan, electric car sales shares doubled and the average price of an 
imported electric car fell almost threefold between 2023 and 2024. 
In Africa, local policies and changing trade regimes are reshaping the electric car 
market. Developments such as the ban on imports of petrol and diesel cars 
introduced in Ethiopia at the start of 2024 have resulted in a reported deployment 
of 100 000 electric vehicles.3 While model availability appears to be reasonable in 
the country, there are reports that garages struggle to source components for 
repairs, and that deployment of chargers outside of the capital has not kept pace 
with electric car sales. In Morocco and Egypt, efforts by car manufacturers to 
expand their production lines for batteries and/or electric cars in order to facilitate 
exports to the European Union have also pushed up domestic deployment, with 
the sales share reaching just under 2%. Nigeria is now looking into strengthening 
its EV manufacturing capacity with support from Morocco, and in 2024, signed the 
Zero Emission Vehicles Declaration to work towards all new sales of cars and 
vans being zero emission by 2040.  
First quarter sales hint at strong sales for 2025, despite 
many uncertainties 
Electric car sales increased 35% in the first quarter of 2025 
compared to the same period in 2024 
More than 4 million electric cars were sold in the first quarter of 2025 as sales 
grew by 35% compared to the first quarter of 2024, which was higher than the 
growth rate observed in the first quarters of the previous 2 years. Over 1 million 
more electric cars were sold in the first three months of 2025 compared to the 
same period in 2024 and about 60% of these were sold in China.  
 
 
3 Data on electric car deployment in Ethiopia is difficult to obtain, and sources are not well aligned. The Ministry of Transport 
of Ethiopia reports a stock of 100 000 electric vehicles but does not define how many of these are cars. In contrast, EV 
Volumes reports about 1 300 electric car sales in the past 5 years.

Between January and March 2025, China averaged monthly sales of around 
875 000 electric cars, with total sales of more than 2.5 million. While the electric 
sales share was less than 45% in January, it reached more than 50% in both 
February and March. Across the full first quarter, the share of electric car sales 
was similar to that of 2024.  
In Europe, electric car sales reached more than 900 000 in the first quarter of 
2025, 625 000 of which were sold in the European Union. The electric sales share 
has also been increasing, averaging one in four cars sold in Europe in the first 
three months of 2025. In the United Kingdom, electric cars represented 30% of 
cars sold in the first quarter, while in the European Union the share was less than 
25%.  
More than 360 000 electric cars were sold in the United States in the first three 
months of 2025, around 10% more than during the same period the previous year. 
Total car sales grew at a similar rate, meaning the electric car sales share in the 
United States remained around 10%, the average across 2024.  
In Canada, the federal government's iZEV incentive programme, which has 
supported electric car adoption with rebates of up to CAD 5 000 (Canadian dollars) 
(USD 3 500) since 2019, was paused in January 2025 as programme funds had 
been fully committed. Despite this, electric cars sales still grew by around 10% in 
the first quarter, in part because some province-level subsidies remain available.  
Several emerging electric car markets continued to see strong growth in the first 
quarter of 2025. In Brazil, for example, electric car sales exceeded 30 000 across 
the first three months of 2025, 40% more than during the same period in 2024. 
Sales in India grew 45% year-on-year, nearing 35 000 electric car sales for the

first quarter of 2025. Electric car sales in Viet Nam also approached 35 000 for the 
first quarter – nearly four times as many as were sold during the first quarter of 
2024 – leading sales across Southeast Asia to double to over 100 000 between 
January and March 2025.   
Electric car sales are expected to exceed 20 million in 2025, 
representing one-quarter of total car sales  
For the full year 2025, electric car sales are expected to increase by 25% globally, 
which is similar to the growth rate from the 2024. As a result, electric car sales top 
20 million worldwide. While sales volumes may be impacted by economic and 
policy uncertainties, more than one in four cars sold in 2025 is expected to be 
electric.  
Building on strong sales in the first quarter of 2025, China is expected to sell over 
14 million electric cars across the full year – more than were sold globally in 2023. 
Sales of both electric and conventional cars are supported by the extension of the 
trade-in scheme for older vehicles. The sales share of electric cars in China is 
expected to reach around 60% in 2025.  
The European Commission announced in March 2025 that OEMs would be given 
flexibilities in meeting the 2025 CO2 targets for cars and vans. On this basis, OEMs 
now only need to achieve the 15% emissions reduction target (compared to the 
2021 baseline) on average over 2025-2027. This announcement was made in 
response to auto industry claims that the 2025 target would be unachievable, and 
would thus incur significant financial penalties that would damage the already 
struggling European auto industry. As yet, it is unclear how different OEMs will 
approach meeting the 3-year average target, in terms of the degree of under-
performance that could be accepted in 2025 but would then need to be 
compensated for in the following 2 years.  
The new phase of the CO2 targets in the European Union is expected to drive up 
electric car sales, although the new flexibilities mean OEMs have less of an 
incentive to bring lower-priced electric cars to market this year. Given that a 
purchase premium for electric cars persists in Europe, the phase-out of EV 
purchase subsidies in some European countries could place downward pressure 
on sales, but there are signs to the contrary. At the end of 2024, the electric car 
purchase subsidy in the Netherlands came to an end, but electric car sales in the 
country in the first quarter of 2025 were about 10% higher than during the same 
period of 2024. In Italy, direct purchase subsidies for electric cars are no longer 
being renewed after 2024, though the government does aim to support the 
domestic production of EVs. In the first three months of 2025, electric car sales in 
Italy were up almost 50%.

Over the course of the year, electric car sales are expected to reach around 
4 million across Europe. In line with this, the share of electric cars sales would 
increase several percentage points compared to 2024, to around 25%. The 
increase in electric car sales across Europe is boosted by the UK Vehicle 
Emissions Trading Scheme, which sets the target of 28% battery electric car sales 
in 2025.  
In the United States, Executive Order 14154 directed the government to 
reconsider market interventions that favour EVs. Legislation has since been 
proposed that would end the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit for both cars and light 
commercial vehicles. In 2025, this proposal may result in consumers that have 
been considering buying an electric car rushing to do so before the tax credit is 
removed. A dampening effect on EV sales in the United States is expected only 
once the tax credit is repealed, and the timeline for that is uncertain. In addition, 
tariffs for conventional and electric cars have also been announced, which may 
result in lower car sales. For the full year, electric car sales in the United States 
are expected grow almost 10% in 2025, with a slight increase in the electric car 
sales share.  
Across the rest of the world, electric car sales are expected to grow by over 30% 
to around 1.8 million. This would mean electric cars account for 6% of all car sales 
outside of the three major EV markets in 2025, up from 5% in 2024. The strong 
growth seen in Southeast Asia and Brazil is expected to continue, reaching sales 
of more than 0.5 million combined in 2025. 
Government spending on electric cars 
Subsidy phase-outs are leading to ever lower shares of 
government spending in the EV market 
As electric car sales have grown over the past decade, government spending per 
vehicle, in the form of purchase subsidies and tax incentives, has steadily declined 
– a trend that accelerated in 2022 as subsidies were phased out. 
In 2024, government spending accounted for less than 7% of total spending on 
electric cars globally, compared to 20% in 2017. In absolute terms, annual 
government spending on electric cars has hovered around the USD 38 billion 
mark since 2022. At the same time, total consumer spending on electric cars 
globally has grown continuously to reach USD 560 billion in 2024.

China has had the largest absolute public spending since 2020, despite its subsidy 
scheme coming to an end in December 2022 after 12 years. Other incentives have 
remained in place – notably, electric cars being exempt from the 10% purchase 
tax that applies to other vehicles. In 2024, China introduced a trade-in subsidy with 
a higher premium for the purchase of EVs. The additional expenditure to support 
EV purchases is estimated to be around USD 2.7 billion for 2024.4 Nevertheless, 
Chinese government expenditure per vehicle dropped 25% between 2022 and 
2024. China has the highest share of subsidies going to PHEVs, at nearly 45%, 
as a result of the 10% purchase tax exemption being applied to PHEVs, which are 
on average more expensive than BEVs. In contrast, government incentives for 
PHEVs have almost disappeared from other key markets.    
In Europe, subsidy schemes were significantly reshaped in 2023 and 2024. The 
most abrupt change was in Germany, where the EUR 4 500 per-vehicle subsidy 
was reduced to zero as of December 2023 – which was followed by a drop in EV 
market share of 4 percentage points in 2024. As a result, the German government  
 
 
 
 
 
4 The original funding allocation for the car trade-in subsidies in 2024 was close to CNY 11.2 billion (USD 1.5 billion), 
however, for the full year, 6.6 million cars were traded in. The additional expenditure for electric car purchases is estimated 
by applying the CNY 5 000 subsidy differential to the 60% of trade-ins that were for the purchase of an electric car.

has introduced new tax benefits for companies buying EVs, effective from July 
2024 through to 2028. Company cars account for about two-thirds of registrations 
in the country.  
In the United Kingdom, all subsidies were removed at the end of 2022 but electric 
car sales have continued to increase, thanks in part to the Vehicle Emissions 
Trading Schemes, which set targets for zero-emission car sales starting from 
2024. In addition, the growth in EV sales was underpinned by a set of tax rebates 
for company cars, which represented about 60% of total car registrations in 2024. 
When factoring in all government tax incentives, an ICE car would incur more than 
10 times the company car tax of an equivalent BEV, compared to Germany where 
this ratio is around 4. 
Similarly, Sweden ended its subsidy programme offering up to SEK 60 000 
(Swedish kronor) (USD 5 800) per electric car in November 2022. Absolute 
volumes of electric car sales in the country decreased 10% in 2024, though the 
country’s EV sales share fell only very slightly due to a drop in overall car sales. 
In several other European countries, subsidies were either reduced in absolute 
terms, or their conditions have become more stringent, with a faster roll-back of 
subsidies for PHEVs. As a result, the average subsidy per vehicle in Europe has 
fallen rapidly, from more than USD 4 500 per vehicle in 2022 to around USD 1 000 
in 2024. The phase-down or interruption of subsidy schemes in Europe has had 
differing consequences on EV market shares at the national level, but the rapid 
decrease in subsidies has not been followed by an equivalent decrease in EV 
market share, providing an encouraging sign of market resilience. 
In the United States, the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act expanded the 
number of vehicles eligible for tax credits in 2023. However, the list of vehicles 
eligible for the USD 7 500 tax credit has since changed repeatedly as Internal 
Revenue Service guidelines have been implemented. The average tax credit in 
2024 was approximately USD 4 000 per vehicle, since not all electric cars were 
eligible and some were eligible for only USD 3 750. In both 2023 and 2024, the 
United States had the highest per-vehicle subsidy of the three major EV markets.

2. Trends in the electric car 
industry 
Manufacturing and trade 
Steady growth in global electric car production masks 
differences at the regional level 
A total 17.3 million electric cars were produced worldwide in 2024, about one-
quarter more than in 2023, largely as a result of increased production in China, 
which reached 12.4 million electric cars. China remains the world’s electric car 
manufacturing hub, accounting for more than 70% of global production in 2024. 
Production in China has been increasingly shaped by the expansion of domestic 
manufacturers. In 2024, Chinese OEMs accounted for more than 80% of domestic 
production, up from roughly two-thirds in 2021. Despite the numerous recently 
announced foreign direct investment plans from Chinese OEMs, their overseas 
production has yet to ramp up. Electric car production by Chinese OEMs operating 
outside China accounted for less than 2% of their global output in 2024. 
In the world’s second-largest electric car manufacturing region, the 
European Union, production stagnated at 2.4 million cars in 2024, but surpassed 
domestic sales by more than 5%. Domestic carmakers were behind nearly 80% 
of the region’s total output, but there were contrasting trends among EU OEMs. 
While German OEMs marked a 5% year-on-year increase in their EU output, other 
EU OEMs (Stellantis and Renault) saw their regional production drop by over 15%, 
producing about 420 000 electric cars, or less than 20% of the region’s output. 
Meanwhile, there was a sixfold increase in EU production by US OEMs between 
2021 and 2024, predominantly led by Tesla and Ford. This contributed to the share 
of foreign OEMs in EU production reaching about 20% in 2024.  
Elsewhere in Europe, the United Kingdom saw its electric car output drop 30% 
year-on-year in 2024 to around 80 000 electric cars, while Türkiye’s production 
grew to 45 000, with two-thirds produced by domestic manufacturer Togg.

Manufacturing trends in North America showed notable contrasts. The gap 
between domestic production and sales in North America has increased steadily 
over the past 3 years. In 2024, despite electric car production falling 7% in the 
United States, overall output across the region remained unchanged year-on-
year, as the decline in US output was offset by Mexico doubling its production to 
220 000 electric cars. US-headquartered carmakers ramping up their 
manufacturing operations in Mexico were responsible for 70% of the country’s total 
output, followed by Japanese and EU OEMs contributing equally to the remaining 
30%. Meanwhile, Canada’s output paled in comparison to its neighbours, 
remaining constant from 2023 at 25 000 vehicles. 
Electric car production also increased in Asia Pacific countries other than China 
to reach about 1 million. While incumbent carmakers such as Japan’s Toyota and 
Korea’s Hyundai were behind most of the region’s output, emerging EV players 
like VinFast in Viet Nam or Tata in India were responsible for an increasing share 
of production, growing from 10% in 2023 to 15% in 2024. In India, in particular, 
domestic OEMs (Tata and Mahindra) accounted for more than 80% of the 75 000 
electric cars produced domestically in 2024.

Global trade of electric cars grew nearly 20% in 2024 
China and the European Union remained the world’s largest EV 
exporters, while Mexico ramped up exports to the United States 
Global electric car exports 1  surged by nearly 20% in 2024, reaching about 
3.2 million electric cars and accounting for almost 20% of global sales, a share 
similar to that seen in 2023 and 2022. As with manufacturing, China accounted 
for the largest share, with 40% of global exports, or nearly 1.25 million electric cars.

In 2024, the European Union saw its exports grow 9% year-on-year to nearly 
830 000 electric cars. The key destination markets for EU-made electric cars 
remained unchanged, with other European countries accounting for almost 60%

in a different location to the country in which they are sold. Global car exports and imports are assessed at the country level, 
except for the European Union, where internal trade between member states is excluded.

of exports (40% to the United Kingdom), followed by North America, accounting 
for about one-quarter of EU exports. The European Union remained a net exporter 
of electric cars in 2024, despite importing about 680 000 electric cars. While 
imports from China remained steady in 2024 at more than 400 000 electric cars 
(60% of EU imports), the share of Chinese OEMs in imports from China grew to 
two-thirds in 2024, up from 50% in the previous year. The Chinese OEM Geely 
accounted for almost 40% of these imports, mainly through its brand Volvo Cars, 
while Tesla’s share decreased from 30% to 20% as more than half of its EU sales 
in 2024 were produced at its German assembly plant. Other European countries 
rely significantly on imports, primarily from the European Union. The majority of 
production elsewhere in Europe is based in the United Kingdom and Türkiye, 
but these countries were responsible for less than 15% of regional sales in 2024. 
China was the second-largest trade partner for electric cars, accounting for more 
than one-quarter of the 840 000 electric cars imported by non-EU European 
countries in 2024. 
The United States remained a net importer of electric cars in 2024. Exports fell 
nearly 15% year-on-year to less than 200 000 electric cars, while imports grew  
40% to 630 000. In 2024, Mexico became the United States' largest electric car 
trade partner, with net exports to the United States reaching 145 000 vehicles. 
Imports from Mexico grew threefold compared to 2023, representing more than 
two-thirds of Mexico’s output. This surge was primarily driven by US OEMs 
(accounting for 70% of Mexico’s exports to the United States) and Japanese 
OEMs (20%). Japan and Korea, previously the largest next exporters to the 
United States, each accounted for net exports of roughly 135 000 vehicles in 2024. 
Despite being the top source of imports in gross terms, the European Union 
ranked fourth in net electric car exports to the United States in 2024, totalling about 
110 000 vehicles. Meanwhile, 40% of US-made electric car exports went to 
Canada in 2024, making it the largest US export market. 
Japan and Korea accounted for the majority of the nearly 640 000 electric cars 
exported from the Asia Pacific region excluding China in 2024, primarily through 
their domestic manufacturers, with an increase of 15% from 2023. The 
United States was the main destination market for these exports, accounting for 
more than a quarter of the 1 million electric cars produced in the region. Europe 
followed, importing another quarter of the region’s production. 
Chinese exports are increasingly driven by domestic OEMs as 
their destinations diversify 
While it remains the world’s largest exporter of electric cars, China experienced a 
noticeable slowdown in export growth in 2024. According to the China Association 
of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), the country exported over 1.15 million

electric cars in 2023, marking a staggering 80% growth from 2022. However, in 
2024, annual export growth fell to just 7%, split unevenly across destination 
markets.   
Several factors contributed to this slowdown. Firstly, the increase in trade 
restrictions resulting from tariff hikes in major export markets prompted Chinese 
OEMs to frontload their exports before such tariffs came into force. In Brazil for 
example, although Chinese imports saw strong year-on-year growth, with an 
increase of 120% in 2024, they dropped sharply by a factor of eight in the second 
half of the year following the reinstatement of tariffs. Europe remained the most 
important export market for Chinese-made electric cars, but weakening demand, 
reluctance of European consumers to buy Chinese EV brands and new 
countervailing duties in the European Union led the share of value attributed to 
Europe in total Chinese EV exports to fall from over 70% in 2021 to roughly 40% 
in 2024. As a result, Chinese exports increasingly shifted towards emerging 
markets such as Mexico (+370%), Southeast Asia (+10%), Russian Federation 
(hereafter: Russia) and countries in the Caspian Sea region.

Inventory build-up by Chinese OEMs also contributed to the slowdown in Chinese 
export growth. In 2023, sales of Chinese-made electric cars outside China fell 
short by 275 000 cars compared to CAAM’s reported exports. This led to clogged 
destination seaports, particularly in Europe and Brazil, and limited the capacity for 
additional imports in 2024 until excess inventory was cleared. However, this 
stockpile helped sustain overseas sales growth of 35% for Chinese-made electric 
cars in 2024, while exports grew only 7%.  
Chinese OEMs accounted for 70% of 2024 total electric car exports from China, 
up from 55% in 2023. To sustain their export momentum, Chinese OEMs are 
investing in expanding shipping capacity through roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) car 
carriers. In 2025, BYD commissioned the world’s largest Ro-Ro vessel, bringing 
its total shipping capacity to more than 30 000 electric cars. Meanwhile, a leading 
Chinese car shipping company, COSCO Shipping Car Carriers, announced plans 
to expand its fleet to handle up to 700 000 cars annually. Despite the 2024 export 
slowdown, this surge in shipping capacity positions Chinese OEMs for renewed 
growth, playing a crucial role in facilitating exports from China and emerging 
manufacturing hubs like Southeast Asia. 
Tightening trade restrictions are pushing Chinese OEMs to 
expand their overseas manufacturing footprint 
As Chinese electric car production continues to outpace domestic demand, 
Chinese OEMs are increasingly looking abroad to capture a larger share of the 
global electric car market. However, tariff changes across several regions are 
making it more difficult for Chinese-made electric cars to remain competitive in key 
destination markets. In 2024, multiple regions introduced new tariffs on Chinese 
electric car imports. This included the European Union, which imposed OEM-
specific countervailing duties on Chinese battery electric car imports, aimed at 
offsetting alleged manufacturing subsidies received by OEMs in China. Meanwhile, 
the United States and Canada implemented new tariffs exceeding 100% in 2024, 
with further increases to tariffs on Chinese imports announced in 2025 in the 
United States, effectively deterring future Chinese electric car imports. Mexico and 
Brazil, both of which have recently experienced a surge in Chinese EV imports, 
have also approved tariff hikes. In 2024, Mexico ended its 15-20% tariff exemption 
on EV imports from countries without a free trade agreement, including China. 
Brazil reinstated 10% import tariffs on electric cars in 2024, with plans to gradually 
raise them every 6 months to reach 35% by the middle of 2026.

Notes: Previous tariffs refer to tariffs in place on 1 January 2024 while new tariffs refer to those in place on 1 January 2025. 
Indonesia has set a waiver on electric vehicle (EV) import duties for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) committing 
to produce locally until 1 January 2026. The free trade agreement between Thailand and China reduces the usually applied 
tariff rate from 80% to 0%. In June 2024, Türkiye imposed a 40% additional tariff on China-made cars and, one month later, 
exempted vehicles imported under investment incentive certificates. Brazil’s import duties on EVs are set to 18% (20% for 
plug-in hybrids) in the first half of 2025 and will gradually increase to 35% by 2026. The European Union’s import duties 
apply only to battery electric cars and vary across OEMs. Russia’s 15% tariff on EV imports does not include the recycling 
fee which amounts to USD 4 400 (RUB 360 000 Russian rubles) per imported EV. The Indian government announced a 
decrease in import duties to 15% for manufacturers committing to produce locally within 3 years with a minimum 
investment of about USD 500 million. 2024 value of Chinese EV exports is taken from General Administration of Customs 
of the People's Republic of China (GACC) interactive trade tables queried with HS codes 870360 and 870380.

These additional export costs are prompting Chinese OEMs to establish new 
overseas manufacturing capacities. The assembly plants being planned are 
intended to both directly supply local markets (like BYD’s plant in Brazil) and 
produce EVs for exports, thereby limiting exposure to tariff hikes targeting imports 
from China (such as from BYD’s plant in Türkiye for exports to the 
European Union).  
Most of the overseas production capacity owned by Chinese OEMs today is in the 
European Union, primarily through Volvo Cars’ assembly plants, which produced 
more than 160 000 electric cars last year. By 2026, when including both EV-only 
assembly plants and dual EV/ICE assembly plants, overseas manufacturing 
capacity belonging to Chinese OEMs is expected to almost double to reach over 
4.3 million vehicles per year. Europe and Southeast Asia are likely to remain the 
primary locations of these new electric car assembly plants, with almost half of the 
total Chinese overseas manufacturing capacity being located in Europe by 2026.

Notes: EV = electric vehicle. Manufacturing capacity refers to plants producing EVs, either exclusively or alongside internal 
combustion engine cars without specifying the EV share. The EV-only share is calculated as the share of EV-only 
commissioned and announced assembly plants in total manufacturing capacity shown. Volvo brand commitments to reach 
a 50% and 90% EV share in its 2025 and 2030 sales, respectively, are treated as EV-only manufacturing capacity and are 
therefore accounted for in the EV-only share. Both full-process manufacturing and knocked-down (in which pre-
manufactured components are imported and assembled) types of assembly plants are considered. Announcements refer to 
committed investments only.

Thanks to policies supporting EV manufacturing, access to raw materials, and a 
well-established automotive industry, Southeast Asia is poised to see the largest 
increase in Chinese OEMs’ overseas manufacturing capacity. Countries including 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Viet Nam have all put in place policies either 
favouring domestic manufacturing over imports, or providing exemptions from 
import and income taxes for OEMs committing to produce domestically. As a result, 
the combined EV-only and dual EV/ICE manufacturing capacity of Chinese OEMs 
in Southeast Asia is set to increase almost threefold by 2026 to reach 1.2 million 
vehicles (more than one-quarter of the total overseas manufacturing capacity of 
Chinese OEMs).

Model availability 
The number of electric car models keeps growing, 
especially for larger cars and SUVs 
Available electric car models could number more than 1 000 by 
2026 
The number of available models for electric cars increased 15% year-on-year to 
reach nearly 785 in 2024. While today there are 50% fewer electric models than 
ICE and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) 2 models, this gap is narrowing and is 
expected to shrink to around 30% by 2027 based on announcements by OEMs.  
While its EV sales share remained largely unchanged, Europe saw the fastest 
increase in model availability over the past year, with a jump from 290 models to 
more than 360. The growth seen in 2024 is expected to almost double by 2026: 
As stricter emissions standards come into force in the European Union, more than 
140 additional models are due to enter the market. For example, Volkswagen and 
Stellantis have announced plans to introduce about 35 new electric models 
between them by 2026.

2 A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), which is powered by an ICE in combination with one or more electric motors using energy 
from batteries, can be in either a mild configuration or a full configuration. Mild hybrids use a battery and electric motor to 
help power the vehicle but cannot power the vehicle using electricity alone. A full hybrid can power a vehicle using electricity 
over short distances and at low speeds, thanks to its more powerful electric motor and larger battery. HEV batteries are 
charged through regenerative braking and by the ICE; HEVs cannot be plugged in to charge the battery and are not 
considered under the definition of electric vehicle.

The share of larger cars and SUVs among EV models coming onto the market 
continues to expand. In 2024, 70% of available EV models were large (segments 
E to F) cars, SUVs or pick-ups, compared to 65% in 2023. Nevertheless, there are 
signs that this share is levelling out in some markets. In Europe, 23 additional 
small electric models (segments A and B) are expected to join the 33 small models 
currently on the market. The United States has the lowest number of small electric 
models available, and nearly 90% of models available today are large cars or 
SUVs. 
China has the most EV models across all segments  
The highest model availability for electric cars can be found in China, where nearly 
60% of all models on offer are electric – 5 times more than the number of electric 
models available in the United States. The large car and SUV segments are the 
most profitable for OEMs, and many have therefore developed these models as a 
preference. As a result, the number of small and medium models available in 
China is only one-third of the number of large or SUV models.  
Yet despite model availability being more limited than for large cars, the small car 
segment is nearly fully electrified in China, with more than 90% of sales in the 
segment being electric. There were 45 small electric car models available in 2024, 
compared to fewer than 10 small conventional cars. The decline in number of 
conventional small models started in 2014 and by 2017 electric and conventional 
models were on par with around 30 models each. The small electric Seagull from 
BYD was one of the best-selling cars of 2024 across all segments and the best-
selling small car, with about 440 000 sales. Sales came in just slightly behind the 
best-selling model overall, the Tesla Model Y (an SUV), which reached 485 000 
sales. The fast pace of electrification of the small segment can be attributed to 
their affordability (see EV affordability in China), in combination with a push for 
local manufacturing and measures to improve air quality in China’s provincial ‘tier 
3’ cities.  
In contrast, in Japan and Europe, the large car segment is the most electrified, 
and the small car segment the least. However, this does not necessarily reflect 
model availability: in Japan, the share of electric models on offer in the large car 
segment is about 50%, but only 6% of large car sales are electric. Similarly, in 
Europe, where more than 40% of all small and medium models available are 
electric, the electric sales share in these segments is just 20%. In the 
United States there are nearly 100 electric large or SUV models available, which 
is less than half of the number of ICE and HEV models available. 
Growing model availability supports EV adoption, but price appears to be the key 
determinant of EV penetration within small and medium size segments. People 
purchasing small and medium cars are likely to be more price sensitive than

buyers of larger models, making price parity particularly important for electrifying 
these segments. In Germany, less than 5% of small BEVs sold were cheaper than 
their ICE equivalent, as described in the section on EV affordability in Europe.

In major markets, battery electric models now represent around 
two-thirds of all electric car models 
There are now more BEV models available than PHEV models. Over time, the 
share of BEV models among total electric car models in China, Europe and the 
United States has converged to reach a ratio of about two BEVs for every PHEV. 
While BEVs were the focus for OEMs in the early years (2014 and earlier), their 
share among electric car models then dropped in Europe, Japan and the 
United States, before beginning to increase again around 2020 in the 
United States and Europe. In Japan, the split remains at 50:50, while the average 
globally is more than three BEV models for every two PHEVs. Within the PHEV 
segment, the number of extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) models has 
grown in recent years, increasing by 40% from 31 models in 2023 to 43 models in 
2024 (see Box below).

OEMs adopt different strategies for electric model 
announcements in different regions 
The number of electric models on the Chinese market today is already greater 
than the number of ICE and hybrid models. Based on announcements, and 
assuming the level of ICE and hybrid models remains constant, by 2030 there will 
be two electric models available for every conventional car model. Domestic 
OEMs such as BYD and Geely already offer twice as many electric models than 
conventional models. This is in contrast to the offering from OEMs headquartered 
elsewhere in the world, which have slightly fewer electric than ICE models 
available in China. However, this balance is likely to shift in favour of electric by 
2030, with around 80 additional electric models announced. OEMs headquartered 
in Europe (such as Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes) offer the most electric 
models after Chinese OEMs.  
Based on electric car model announcements, the gap between the number of 
conventional and electric models shrinks the most to 2030 in the European 
market. Chinese OEMs in this market already offer more electric models than 
conventional models, but European OEMs are now closing the gap by increasing 
their electric offerings by 50% by 2030, which is more than OEMs headquartered 
in other regions. About 40% of these new EV models are small or medium cars. 
Volkswagen and Stellantis, both of which have a greater focus on these vehicle 
segments than other European OEMs, are behind more than half of all 
announcements for small or medium models in the European market, as they are 
urged to release affordable models to meet their fleet-wide CO2 target in the short 
term.

In the North American market, larger cars are the focus for many OEMs. Of the 
110 electric car models available today, only 2 are small (the Mini Cooper BEV 
and Fiat 500 BEV), with sales totalling 3 000 in 2024 – less than 1% of all electric 
car sales. However, about 15% of the electric models due to enter the market in 
the next few years are medium sized, compared to 9% of available models today. 
Despite an increase of about 145 electric models by 2030, which will more than 
double the model availability for electric cars in the region, the number of 
conventional models will remain 70% higher.

Electric vehicle range 
No change to average range of battery electric cars in 
2024 
The sales-weighted average range (hereafter, “average range”) of battery electric 
cars globally remained the same in 2024, at about 340 km under on-road 
conditions. The average range was significantly lower for small cars, at just above 
150 km, while medium and large cars, as well as SUVs, all maintained ranges 
above 350 km. As market competition intensifies, the fact that average range has 
stabilised in the past year could indicate that carmakers have found an optimal 
balance between range performance and vehicle manufacturing costs. This 
levelling-off of driving range also offers energy and environmental benefits, as 
longer ranges also require larger batteries, which increase vehicle energy 
consumption and demand for critical minerals. 
In the United States and Europe, the average electric range increased by less than 
5%, primarily driven by the growing interest in electric SUVs, which continued to 
dominate the EV market – exceeding 75% of sales in the United States and 
reaching around 60% in Europe. Across Europe, the average range of a battery 
SUV car reached almost 400 km under on-road conditions. Nevertheless, this falls 
short of the 500 km that respondents to a recent survey stated as their range 
preference. Meanwhile, in China, the average range remained stable as EV 
producers prioritised cost-cutting in the face of strong domestic competition.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are growing in popularity in 
China 
Consumers purchasing large cars and SUVs in China are increasingly opting to 
buy plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as a more flexible option. The key 
appeal of PHEVs lies in their ability to handle long trips even when charging 
infrastructure is insufficient or congested. PHEV electric range in China grew by 
over 20% between 2020 and 2024, reaching almost 100 km. In contrast, electric 
ranges stalled in Europe and the United States at about 65 km. The environmental 
benefit of PHEVs largely depends on charging behaviour, which can lead to real-
world tailpipe CO2 emissions that are significantly higher than type-approval 
values.

Extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) have gained ground in recent years, 
almost entirely as a result of growing adoption in China. Uptake has been primarily 
in larger and heavier high-end vehicle segments. In 2024, EREV models 
accounted for nearly 25% of electric SUV sales in China, and they dominated the 


Global EV Outlook 2025 
Trends in the electric car industry

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
larger end of the electric SUV segment, making up 60% of large electric SUV sales 
(over 4.8 metres in length). More than 70% of the 40 EREV models available today 
belong to the SUV category (including multi-purpose vehicles and pick-up trucks), 
while the rest is mostly part of the large car segment category. In total, 14 
additional EREV models are expected to be released by the end of 2025. Similarly, 
the four announced EREV models due for launch outside of China by 2026 (by 
Scout and RAM in the United States and Changan in Europe), in addition to the 
two already available today (Mazda and Leapmotor in Europe), are all positioned 
within the large pick-up truck and SUV segments.  
 
Extended-range electric vehicles: advantages and limitations  
In 2024, the average EREV in China had an electric range of about 120 km, compared 
to around 85 km for a standard PHEV. While the range of a standard PHEV has 
increased significantly in recent years, the longer electric range of EREVs could 
reduce charging frequency, increase the share of electric-only driving and lower 
reliance on liquid fuels. 
As with standard PHEVs, the environmental benefits of EREVs are heavily influenced 
by charging behaviour and are generally overestimated in type-approval vehicle fuel 
economy ratings. In addition, when EREVs run on low battery, their fuel consumption 
compared to standard PHEVs varies depending on driving conditions. In some urban 
or low-power driving conditions, EREVs can be more fuel-efficient. However, in many 
other cases when the battery is low, the opposite is true: standard PHEVs tend to use 
less fuel because their engines can drive the wheels directly, unlike EREVs, which 
rely on a generator as an intermediate energy converter. 
The components of EREVs also differ from those of standard PHEVs. EREVs require 
a generator, advanced power electronics and a larger battery, which can increase 
manufacturing costs, although the lack of traditional transmission and simpler engine 
design can reduce costs. Their competitiveness compared to standard PHEVs  largely 
depends on optimising the size of the generator and battery, which are responsible 
for the majority of additional costs. Moreover, their chassis design, which is closer to 
that of a BEV than a standard PHEV, could accelerate technology transfer from 
rapidly evolving BEV battery pack and chassis technologies. 
However, as battery electric cars continue to improve in range, charging speed and 
affordability, their simpler architecture and higher efficiency could outweigh the trend 
towards EREVs. Ultimately, wider adoption of EREVs will largely depend on the range 
and affordability of equivalent BEV models, as well as the availability of charging 
infrastructure.

Electric car affordability 
Falling battery pack prices and intensifying competition 
underpin progress in electric car affordability 
Today, electric cars often have a lower total cost of ownership than ICE cars over 
the vehicle lifetime, due to reduced fuel and maintenance expenses. However, 
reducing the purchase price3 gap will be key to broader uptake. In Europe, for 
example, respondents to a 2023 survey by the European Commission identified 
the price of battery electric cars as the main barrier to adoption. While battery 
electric car prices generally fell in 2024, the price gap with ICE cars remains in 
most regions.  
Electric car affordability has made significant strides over the past decade, 
primarily driven by falling battery prices, intensifying market competition and 
carmakers reaching economies of scale. In 2024, despite the global average 
battery size growing slightly, the global average battery pack price fell more than 
25% compared with 2023 levels. This resulted in a global drop in electric car 
manufacturing costs that was reflected in the price of electric cars.

However, the trend towards falling prices has been uneven across markets, due 
to differences in carmakers’ pricing strategies, and in market maturity and the level 
of competition. For example, in China, the sales-weighted average (hereafter, 
“average”) price of a battery electric SUV fell almost 10% year-on-year in 2024, 
partly due to the 30% decline in the battery pack price. Similarly, in the 
United States, a 15% decline in battery prices contributed to a 3% drop in the 
average purchase price of electric SUVs in 2024. In contrast, in Germany, the 
price of electric SUVs slightly increased in 2024, despite their battery pack prices 
declining 20%. This suggests that the battery pack price is not the only factor 
influencing EV prices: other component manufacturing costs, trim levels and 
carmakers’ pricing strategies also play a significant role.

Availability of a wide range of affordable EV models will be key to unlocking mass-
market adoption. In 2024, there were fewer BEV models available than ICEV 
models in the United States and Europe, and the range was skewed towards 
higher-end models with higher prices. Conversely, in China, the price distribution 
of available BEV models closely resembles that of ICEVs, with about 40% of 
available electric models priced below USD 25 000 (against 45% for ICEV 
models), and more than half below USD 30 000. In 2024, this price distribution 
was reflected in sales, with the median price paid for a battery electric car standing 
at around USD 24 000, about USD 700 less than for an ICE car. This trend

towards a larger share of more affordable models is expected to continue in the 
short term, as 60% of announced models with a known price are expected to 
launch below the USD 30 000 mark.  
Contrasting trends were also seen in the affordability of plug-in hybrids. In China, 
prices for medium PHEVs dropped 15% from 2023 to 2024, and SUV-type PHEV 
prices fell 7% over the same period. However, in Germany, the average purchase 
price of medium and SUV-type PHEVs grew more than 5% year-on-year. This was 
partly driven by their average battery size growing, causing their battery pack 
prices to increase by about 15%. In 2024, in Europe, only 1 of the around 
130 PHEV models was priced under USD 40 000, compared with more than 
40 BEV and 155 ICEV models marketed below this price tag. Similarly, in the 
United States, the 4 cheapest PHEV models available were priced between 
USD 30 000 and USD 40 000, while about 60 ICEV models were marketed below 
this price range. The US and German markets contrasted markedly with that of 
China, where nearly 40 PHEV models were available with a price tag below 
USD 25 000, competing with more than 250 ICEV and 140 BEV models within the 
same price range.  
Price-competitive electric cars in China are driving rapid 
electrification across all segments 
In China, the rapid electrification of small cars has been underpinned by their 
unrivalled affordability. In 2024, nearly all small battery electric car models in China 
were priced lower than the average small ICE car, and the average purchase price 
was about half that of the average small ICE car. This led to the almost complete 
electrification – nearly 95% – of small car sales in China in 2024, up from a share 
of 75% 3 years earlier. Nevertheless, the small car segment makes up only a small 
share of the Chinese car market, accounting for less than 10% of sales in 2024.

In 2024, BEVs also reached price parity with ICEVs in the SUV segment – the 
most popular car segment in China, accounting for half of all car sales. More than 
half of battery electric SUV sales were priced lower than an average ICE SUV. 
Plug-in hybrid SUVs were also sold at cheaper price levels than ICEV models for 
the third consecutive year, supporting their steady uptake in this vehicle segment. 
While progress on affordability has supported the growing sales shares of BEVs 
and PHEVs, adoption of EREVs seemed to be more a result of consumer 
preferences rather than purchase price competitiveness. In 2024, the average 
price premium of EREVs over ICEV models stood at 60%, marking slim progress 
from 70% three years ago. Despite their higher purchase price, the market share 
of EREVs within the SUV segment grew to reach 10% in 2024, suggesting that 
this hybrid powertrain technology is appealing to wealthier consumers who are 
less price sensitive and seek boosted range in high-end vehicle models.  
In the medium car segment, which represents about one-third of total car sales in 
China, BEVs were 20% more expensive than conventional equivalents in 2024, 
down from 40% in 2021. PHEV prices also dropped. For the first time, the sales-
weighted average price of medium PHEVs in 2024 was 10% lower than 
conventional models. As a result, PHEV sales in the segment more than doubled, 
and more than one-third of medium car sales in China in 2024 were electric.  
Electric car affordability improved in all car segments in China thanks to falling 
battery pack prices, a high level of supply chain vertical integration and fierce 
competition within the Chinese EV market. Overall, in 2024, close to two-thirds of 
the battery electric cars sold in China were cheaper than their ICE equivalents, up 
from half in 2021 and just 10% in 2018.  
Affordability stagnates in Europe, but carmakers expand line-
ups with low-cost EVs amid CO2 standards shift 
In Europe, carmakers’ pricing strategies and focus on high-profit-margin premium 
models have led to stagnating battery electric car prices. In Germany, for example, 
the average price premium for small battery electric cars remained almost 
unchanged between 2021 and 2023, plateauing at over 50% more than equivalent 
small ICE models. The price premium for small battery electric cars fell slightly in 
2024 to around 45%. In contrast, the price premium for battery electric SUVs 
increased to reach 20% in 2024, effectively reversing the small decrease seen 
over the 2021-2023 period. The price premium of PHEVs compared to 
conventional equivalents has grown consistently since 2022, reaching more than 
30% for medium-size cars and 50% for SUV-type cars in 2024. This trend hindered 
electric car adoption in Germany in 2024, especially when combined with the 
phase-out of purchase subsidies in late 2023. In 2021, almost one-third of battery 
electric SUVs sold in the country were cheaper than their average ICE equivalent, 
but by 2024, this share had fallen to one-fifth.

In other European countries, the affordability of electric cars saw little change. In 
the United Kingdom, for instance, the average price premium of battery electric 
SUVs made only slim progress, dropping to 30% in 2024 from 40% in 2021. The 
pricing trend of plug-in hybrid SUVs was similar, with their price premium having 
been stuck at around 45% for the last 3 years.

This lack of progress on affordability reflects the limited availability of cheap 
electric car models across Europe. In 2024, while nearly one-quarter of available 
ICE car models were priced below EUR 30 000, only around 5% of battery electric 
models were. Models priced below EUR 25 000 are expected to be key enablers 
of wider market adoption, but they accounted for only a slim share (3%) of 
available battery electric models in Europe last year. However, the new phase of 
the EU CO2 standards entering into force in 2025 is expected to prompt carmakers 
to release more affordable electric models to boost their EV sales and comply with 
their respective fleet-wide CO2 targets. So far, both European and foreign 
carmakers have announced launches of battery electric models for the European 
market priced at under EUR 25 000, including Renault, Volkswagen, Hyundai, and 
BYD. Overall, nearly ten battery electric models priced at under EUR 25 000 are 
expected to be released by the end of 2026. 
Limited availability of affordable models hinders US electric car 
sales growth 
In 2024 in the United States, about one in five electric SUVs (including pick-up 
trucks) was sold at a lower price than the average conventional SUV. This is 
particularly significant given that SUVs account for three-quarters of total car sales 
in the United States. Progress on battery electric car affordability has fluctuated in 
recent years. In 2023, the average purchase price premium of battery electric 
SUVs noticeably decreased to 25% from 50% in 2022, largely as a result of Tesla 
repeatedly slashing prices in an attempt to maintain its market lead in the 
United States. However, despite further price reductions to the Tesla Model Y SUV 
in 2024, Tesla’s market share fell around 10% year-on-year. This decline 
outweighed the impact of the late price cuts, leaving the average price premium 
of battery electric SUVs in the United States unchanged from the previous year. 
The contrast with conventional models is stark: in 2024, only 2 battery electric 
models (3% of battery electric car models) were priced below USD 30 000, 
compared to more than 50 ICE models (20% of available ICE models). In the short 
term, Honda, Fisker and Volkswagen have all recently announced they will launch 
“affordable” compact electric SUVs, bringing to market a handful of models under 
the USD 30 000 mark. However, most of the BEV model releases expected by 
2026 that have been announced with launch prices are in the premium car 
category, with over 70% anticipated to have a purchase price of more than 
USD 50 000.

The average purchase price of plug-in hybrid SUVs has increased over the past 3 
years. In 2024, the price was almost 10% higher than that of battery electric 
counterparts, and 35% higher than conventional SUV models. Fewer than 10% of 
the more than 50 available PHEV models were priced below USD 40 000 while 
70% were above USD 50 000. This high price premium, combined with the limited 
availability of affordable models, remains a significant barrier to wider adoption. 
As a result, PHEV sales stood at 2% of total SUV sales in 2024, as in 2023.  
In emerging markets, affordable Chinese models are driving EV 
adoption 
In 2024, in most emerging EV markets, the price of the cheapest battery electric 
car was lower than the average price of an ICE car. In some markets – such as 
Indonesia, Thailand and Mexico – the cheapest battery electric car models even

retailed at similar prices to the cheapest ICE models. Choosing an electric car in 
these markets could carry little to no price premium.  
In all of the five emerging markets assessed – Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico and 
Thailand – electric models made by Chinese OEMs were, on average, cheaper 
than the average electric car, helping to drive uptake. The cheapest Chinese 
battery electric car was, in most cases, also the cheapest option on the market, 
so much that in Thailand in 2024, the average price of a Chinese EV was lower 
than the average price of a conventional car. In 2023 and 2024, more than four 
out of every five battery electric cars sold in Thailand were imported from China, 
bringing the average price of BEVs nearly in line with that of conventional cars. 
On average, medium and SUV model BEVs were more than 20% cheaper than 
their conventional equivalents, and the overall price premium of BEVs, across all 
car segments, stood below 5%.

In Brazil, where Chinese electric car imports increased to reach 85% of the 
country’s EV sales in 2024, up from about 60% in 2023, the price gap between 
battery electric and ICE cars shrank from more than 100% to 25% over the same 
period. In 2024, not only was the cheapest battery electric car model produced in 
China by a Chinese OEM, but Chinese BEVs also retailed at less than half the 
price of those produced by non-Chinese OEMs on average (most of which belong

to larger car segments). The average price of PHEVs also fell in 2024. In 
particular, plug-in hybrid SUVs – which accounted for nearly half of Brazil’s electric 
car sales in 2024 – saw their price premium over ICE equivalents drop below 70%, 
compared to a premium of more than 80% for battery electric SUVs. This 
decreasing price gap boosted the adoption of PHEVs within the SUV segment, 
whereas BEVs gained more traction in the small and medium car segments, where 
their average price premium halved year-on-year to reach less than 40% in 2024. 
In Indonesia, after import duties were waived under local investment 
requirements, Chinese EV imports surged to reach two-thirds of the country’s EV 
sales in 2024, up from about 10% in 2023. Like in other emerging markets, 
Chinese battery electric car models became the most affordable options available, 
with an average price over 60% lower than BEVs from non-Chinese OEMs. As a 
result, the average price premium of BEVs dropped to around 50% in 2024, down 
from being, on average, twice as expensive as conventional cars in 2023. 
In Mexico, the average price premium of BEVs fell to 50% in 2024 from more than 
100% in 2023, as the share of Chinese imports in EV sales grew to nearly two-
thirds. However, Chinese brands were not the only ones driving affordability. While 
the cheapest BEV model available (Renault’s Kwid E-Tech Electric) was produced 
in China, it was sold under a European brand.  
In India, high import duties on EVs and the availability of locally made, affordable 
electric models meant the share of Chinese imports in the country’s EV sales 
remained below 15% in 2024. While the cheapest battery electric car model was 
produced locally by a Chinese OEM (SAIC’s city car, the MG Comet EV, priced 
under USD 8 000), the average price of imported Chinese BEVs was twice that of 
those made by domestic manufacturers. In 2024, all BEV models manufactured 
by Indian carmakers started below USD 20 000, while none of the imported 
Chinese BEV models were priced under that threshold. Overall, the average price 
gap between battery electric and ICE cars fell below 15% for small cars and 25% 
for SUVs in 2024

3. Trends in other light-duty 
electric vehicles 
Electric two- and three-wheelers 
Contrasting regional trends mean global sales of electric 
two- and three-wheelers remain at around 15% 
Two- and three-wheelers (2/3Ws)1 remained the most electrified road transport 
segment in 2024, with more than 9% of the global fleet now electric. The global 
sales share of electric models remained at around 15% in 2024 with total electric 
model sales reaching 10 million. The electric sales share stalled in 2024, mostly 
due to the shrinking Chinese electric 2/3W market, although growth in other 
regions was steady. China, India and Southeast Asia remain the world’s largest 
2/3W markets, accounting for around 80% of 2024 global sales, with 2/3Ws 
serving as the primary mode of private passenger transport in India and Southeast 
Asia.  
Electric 2/3Ws stand out as the most affordable and accessible entry point into 
electric mobility. Unlike cars, many models do not rely on extensive charging 
infrastructure, as removable batteries allow users to charge at home, and those 
with private parking or garages can easily charge their electric 2/3Ws using 
standard sockets. The removable batteries have also led to the growing 
emergence of battery swapping stations for 2/3Ws, which can be particularly 
useful for 2/3Ws that are used as taxis or for delivery services, where quick 
recharging is highly valued. This – combined with lower operating costs when 
compared to cars – means that electric 2/3Ws offer a promising solution for 
reducing urban emissions and improving air quality in emerging markets and 
developing economies, where 2/3Ws are widely used for daily transportation.  
Another year of receding electric two-wheeler sales in 
China masks steady growth elsewhere in Asia  
In China, falling sales of electric 2Ws in 2024 were the product of an overall 
decline in the 2W market, yet the country remains the world’s largest market for 
electric 2Ws. Electric models have accounted for more than half of 2W sales since 
 
 
1 In this report, “two-wheelers” refers to vehicles with a top speed of at least 25 km/hr that fit the L1 and L3 classes defined 
by UNECE. This excludes micromobility options such as electric-assisted bicycles and low-speed electric scooters. The 
definition of a three-wheeler is aligned with UNECE L2, L4 or L5 classes.

2020, with sales totalling about 7 million in 2024. Sluggishness in China’s 2W 
market reflects an increasing preference for cars for personal transport, and may 
also be a sign that consumers are responding to tighter restrictions on 2W use in 
major cities. The 2W market is shifting toward higher-value motorcycle models, 
likely indicating a change in consumer profile. At the same time, the Chinese 
government launched a trade-in programme for electric bicycles in 2024, boosting 
their sales. Urban commuters, in particular, may be attracted by e-bikes as a 
lower-cost alternative that enables access to bike lanes and areas where 2Ws are 
banned.  
As the Chinese market for electric 2Ws continues to decline, the country’s OEMs 
are looking abroad for growth opportunities. China’s largest electric 2W 
manufacturer, Yadea, broke ground on a USD 150 million new assembly plant in 
Indonesia in 2024, which has a planned output of 3 million vehicles by 2028 (likely 
to also include e-bikes). In recent years, Chinese OEMs have also established 
manufacturing capacities in other large Southeast Asian electric 2W markets such 
as Viet Nam, the Philippines and Thailand, making their way into the top five 
electric 2W brands in each of these countries.

India’s increasingly dynamic electric 2W market hosted a total of 220 OEMs in 
2024, up from 180 in 2023, although the 4 market leaders accounted for a 
combined 80% of the 1.3 million electric 2Ws sold in the country in 2024 (6% of 
the overall 2W market). While the upfront purchase price of electric 2Ws remains 
higher on average than that of conventional 2Ws, increasing competition is 
prompting OEMs to offer more affordable electric models. For example, the Indian 
market leader, Ola, released its S1X entry model, equipped with a 2 kWh battery 
and 6 kW peak power, with a sticker price of INR 70 000 (about USD 850) – lower 
than the average price of the five best-selling ICE 2W models. Policy support is 
also helping to bridge the affordability gap between electric and ICE 2W models, 
with the new PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM 
E-DRIVE) policy continuing financial support formerly provided under both Faster 
Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME)-II and Electric Mobility 
Promotion Scheme measures. This provides purchase incentives for electric 2Ws 
(offering purchase subsidies of up to INR 5 000/kWh for 2Ws fitted with lithium-ion 
batteries), as well as for 3Ws and other emerging EV categories (specifically 
excluding private cars), with a total budget of USD 1.3 billion. The scheme is 
planned to operate until March 2026 to support the roll-out of about 2.5 million 
electric 2Ws, up from 1 million targeted under the previous FAME-II policy. On the 
manufacturing side, the 80 largest electric 2W makers in India accounted for a 
combined production capacity of 10 million electric 2Ws in 2024, almost 8 times 
the domestic sales that year. Capacity is expected to increase to 17 million electric 
2Ws in the near term, if all OEM announcements come to fruition. 
Southeast Asia made notable progress on 2W electrification in 2024, particularly 
in Viet Nam, which recorded 250 000 sales (a sales share close to 10%); in 
Indonesia, where there were about 105 000 sales; and in the Philippines, with 
more than 25 000. Indonesia saw its electric 2W market almost double in size, 
but the share of electric sales remained below 2%. Nevertheless, the trend 
towards electrification in what is the world’s third-largest 2W market is likely to 
continue given the strong policy support in place (in 2023, nearly USD 0.5 billion 
was allocated to support the deployment  of 800 000 electric 2Ws over the 
following years), as well as the new manufacturing capacity being rolled out by 
established Chinese OEMs.  
Viet Nam’s 2W electrification success story has been underpinned by the 
continued roll-out of increasingly affordable electric 2W models manufactured by 
domestic champions like VinFast and Pega, and now also by Chinese OEMs. To 
date, several electric models are sold at under VND 20 million (Vietnamese dong) 
(USD 780) (such as VinFast’s Evo200 and Yadea’s Orla), making them price-
competitive with conventional alternatives. These affordable purchase prices are 
partly a result of existing battery leasing options, which reduce the vehicle 
purchase price and can cost consumers as little as VND 350 000 (under USD 14) 
per month. They can also be easily integrated with battery swap programmes. The

increasing affordability of electric models, ongoing development of charging 
infrastructure for models without removable batteries, and Viet Nam’s ambition to 
fully electrify its road transport sector by 2050 is likely to drive further growth in 
electric 2W sales in the coming years.  
Sales of electric 2Ws in Africa grew nearly 40% year-on-year to reach 9 000 
vehicles, marking a slim 0.5% sales share in the continent’s total 2W sales. 
However, domestic OEMs have invested significantly in recent years to set up 
domestic manufacturing facilities. For example, Spiro is set to break ground on an 
assembly plant in Nigeria in 2025 with an expected annual output of 100 000 
electric 2Ws, 100 times the capacity of its assembly plants in Togo and Benin. 
Other electric 2W manufacturers, such as Roam in Kenya and Ampersand in 
Rwanda, also recently announced investments to ramp up their capacity across 
African countries. Beyond increasing manufacturing investments, asset financiers 
like M-KOPA, Mogo, and Watu are helping consumers and small business owners 
access electric motorcycles through flexible payment plans and lease-to-own 
schemes. 
Elsewhere, in Europe, the average electrification rate of 2W sales has decreased 
to about 6%, despite the 2W market growing overall. With year-on-year sales 
growing to more than 50 000 electric 2Ws, Türkiye has secured its position as the 
leading market outside of Asia, followed by France and the Netherlands, despite 
those markets stagnating in 2024.  
India continues to drive most growth in the global 
electric three-wheeler market 
Despite the global three-wheeler (3W) market shrinking 5% from the previous 
year, electric 3W sales grew more than 10% to surpass 1 million vehicles in 2024. 
Electric 3W sales represented almost one-quarter of all 3W sales, up from one-
fifth in 2023. The market is highly concentrated, with China and India together 
accounting for more than 90% of both electric and conventional 3W sales.

Electrification of 3Ws in China has stagnated at less than 15% over the past 
3 years. In 2023, India overtook China to become the world’s largest market for 
electric 3Ws, and it maintained this position in 2024, with sales growing close to 
20% year-on-year to reach nearly 700 000 vehicles. This translated into a record 
57% electric sales share in 2024, 3% up on the previous year. This growing trend 
looks set to continue thanks to policy support under the new PM E-DRIVE scheme, 
which allocated budget in 2024 to support the roll-out of more than 300 000 electric 
3Ws for commercial use – for which the total fleet (electric and ICE) was estimated 
at more than 10 million vehicles in 2023. 
Elsewhere, in Europe, the electric 3W sales share has grown steeply in the past 
2 years, pushed up by growth in the Turkish market. In 2024, Türkiye accounted 
for 60 000 electric 3Ws sold out of a total European 3W market of about 90 000.  
Electric light commercial vehicles 
China pushed up global electric light commercial vehicle 
sales in 2024, representing 70% of global sales  
Sales of electric light commercial vehicles (LCVs) increased by more than 40% in 
2024 to exceed 600 000, with a share of 7%, up from 5% in 2023. China and 
Europe remained the two largest markets for electric LCVs in 2024, but while 
China saw growth of almost 90%, with sales reaching roughly 450 000, sales in 
Europe declined by about 10% to less than 120 000. The United States emerged 
as the third-largest market, taking the spot from Korea, with sales of more than 
25 000 and strong year-on-year growth of 55%.

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Notes: LCV = light commercial vehicle, weighing less than 3.5 tonnes. In China, LCVs include small-sized buses, gasoline 
light-duty trucks and mini trucks. To better align with IEA classifications, diesel light-duty trucks are considered as medium-
duty trucks (defined here as having a gross vehicle weight greater than 3.5 tonnes and less than 15 tonnes).  
Sources: IEA analysis based on data from EV Volumes, China Commercial Vehicle Dealers Association, DaaS, ACEA, 
Marklines and Korean Automobile Manufacturer’ Association. 
 
The continued sales growth in China has been supported by LCVs being eligible 
for the vehicle purchase tax exemption for new energy vehicles that was put in 
place in 2014. The full tax exemption has been extended through 2025, and a 50% 
tax exemption will be available until the end of 2027. Preferential road rights 
policies, charging discounts and charging subsidies are further supporting EV 
adoption among commercial users. 
In Europe, the electric sales shares declined in several important LCV markets, 
such as Germany, Norway and France, or stalled, as in the case of Sweden. 
However, in the United Kingdom – the largest market for electric LCVs in Europe 
– sales continued to grow, reaching nearly 7%. As with cars, 2024 was the first 
year of zero-emission van targets under the Vehicle Emissions Trading Scheme, 
which will progressively require higher sales shares of zero-emission LCVs over 
the coming decade.  
Some small markets such as Czechia, Greece, Hungary and especially Romania 
have seen notable increases, albeit starting from a very low base. Despite no new 
incentives being introduced between 2023 and 2024 in these markets, the growth 
suggests that there were some segments that could be easily electrified with 
existing technology. In fact, the total cost of ownership of electric LCVs is already 
equal to or below that of conventional alternatives for certain applications in 
Europe. Nevertheless, in Germany – a more developed market – the decline in 
sales may have been a result of the removal of incentives (which also affected 
LCV applications that are harder to electrify based on current pricing or model

availability) and by the design of the EU CO₂ emission regulations for vans, which 
gave the automotive industry little incentive to accelerate sales in 2024 before the 
next phase taking effect in 2025. 
Some European cities have promoted electric LCV adoption by establishing Low 
Emissions Zones (LEZs), though there is no uniform European regulation, with 
regulations being decided at the city level. London has the largest LEZ in the 
world, which has favoured uptake. As of the beginning of 2025, LEZs can also be 
found in Amsterdam and 14 other cities in the Netherlands, as well as in Brussels, 
Ghent, and Stockholm. In the case of the Netherlands, the introduction of LEZs 
from 2025, together with the exemption of vehicle tax for LCVs being removed for 
ICE LCVs, led the sales share of electric LCVs to leap to more than 90% in the 
first quarter of 2025, compared to less than 10% on average in 2024. The number 
of LEZs in Europe grew significantly from 228 in 2019 to 320 in 2022, with more 
expected to come online in 2025, further encouraging uptake of EVs and 
improving air quality, while also potentially reducing traffic congestion. 
In 2023, the sales share of electric LCVs in Korea was double the level of electric 
passenger cars, continuing a trend that started in 2020. While the sales share of 
electric LCVs remained higher than cars in 2024, both the volume of sales and 
their sales share declined sharply. Despite strong initial adoption of electric LCVs 
in Korea, partially due to the availability of free commercial licence plates for 
electric models, drivers have since reported that real-world range and model 
availability is insufficient for many commercial applications, which may be 
influencing the slowdown. In 2023, the only electric LCVs on the market were the 
Kia Bongo and the Hyundai Porter, both 1-tonne trucks with a battery capacity of 
about 60 kWh. While these vehicles had initially been able to meet the needs of 
some portions of the market, boosting sales, reaching new market segments has 
proved difficult. In 2024, Hyundai launched the ST1 Cargo electric, which has a 
larger battery (76 kWh) and an advertised range of around 300 km, but also has 
a higher purchase price. In 2024, Korea introduced stricter performance 
requirements for their subsidy scheme, which effectively restricted subsidies for 
models with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, typically used in Chinese-
manufactured models.  
Across Europe, Korea and the United States, 2024 saw the introduction of around 
ten new electric LCV models, the majority of which were launched in European 
countries. Ford expanded its e-Transit line, which remains one of the world’s best-
sellers in the electric LCV category, offering a 30% increase in range and more 
possible applications, such as refrigerated delivery. BYD targeted the last-mile 
delivery market in Europe with the E-Vali, while Mercedes-Benz introduced the 
eSprinter in the United States.

Electric LCV fleets are becoming increasingly popular, particularly in the parcel 
delivery sector, as companies strive to reduce their environmental impact and 
operating costs. As part of its goal to reach 100 000 electric delivery vehicles by 
2030, Amazon now has 20 000 vehicles through a 2019 agreement with Rivian, 
which has tailored a vehicle to Amazon's needs, with the first vehicles delivered in 
2021. In 2024, Rivian represented 40% of the US electric LCV market and its sales 
are steadily growing. 
Elsewhere, Ingka Group, the biggest IKEA franchisee, served 40% of home 
deliveries with zero-emission vehicles, advancing towards its goal of more than 
90% by 2028. Shanghai was the first city to reach this goal, achieving 100% EV-
based deliveries as early as 2019. In India, IKEA has partnered with EKA Mobility 
to supply last-mile delivery with electric vans, while in Korea, DHL has partnered 
with Kia to deploy the forthcoming Kia PV5 tailored to DHL needs from 2026.

The electric bus market continued to expand, backed by 
increasingly favourable economics 
Electric bus sales grew by 30% in 2024 
Global sales of electric buses reached more than 70 000 in 2024, driven by 
renewed growth in China. Sales outside of China increased by just 5% in 2024, 
although they have almost tripled compared to 2020. As electric bus sales have 
increased in a range of countries, China’s share of global sales has fallen from 
around 99% in 2017 to less than 70% in 2024. Although electric bus sales in China 
generally declined from 2017 to 2023, the electric bus sales share has remained 
relatively stable, hovering around 60%.

In Europe, the world’s second-largest market for electric buses, sales increased 
by almost 15% in 2024, bringing the sales share to more than 13%. Several 
countries, including Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway, now have 
electric bus sales shares of more than 40%. The United Kingdom continues to 
have the largest number of sales in Europe, accounting for around 20% of the 
region’s sales in 2024, with a year-on-year growth of over 40% and almost 2 000 
electric buses sold in 2024. Italy follows, with almost 1 200 sales, and then 
Germany with almost 900. Sales were predominantly for city buses, for which ten 
European countries had battery electric sales shares above 80%, meaning almost 
half of all new city buses were battery electric in 2024, up from just over 35% in 
2023.  
Uptake of electric buses in the United States has not been linear. Despite 
averaging year-on-year growth of more than 70% between 2020 and 2024, electric 
bus sales declined in 2024 following a peak the previous year. Around 40% fewer 
electric buses were sold last year, in part due to supply chain issues. As a result, 
India and Korea overtook the United States to become the second- and third-
largest national electric bus markets by sales volume in 2024, with more than 
3 200 and 2 800 sales, respectively.  
In Latin America, electric bus sales have risen from around 600 in 2020 to over 
2 000 in 2024, which accounts for almost 40% of sales outside of China, Europe, 
and the countries mentioned above. City buses are driving the transition, like in 
Europe. In Mexico, close to 8% of all bus sales were electric in 2024, up from just 
above 1% in 2023. There has also been impressive growth in Colombia, Chile, 
Brazil, and other countries over the past few years.   
Another notable trend is the decline in the share of PHEVs among electric buses. 
In China, the share of PHEVs in total electric bus sales peaked in 2014 at around 
60%, but fell to less than 1% in 2017 and close to 0% in 2024. Similarly, in the rest 
of the world, there was a peak of around 60% of total electric bus sales in 2015, 
but this fell sharply to 5% in 2017, and around 1% of the share in 2024. Almost all 
electric bus sales are now battery electric, thanks in large part to declining battery 
prices, greater model availability and improved charging technology, all of which 
increase the share of use cases for which they are now practical.  
Even as electric bus economics continue to improve, innovative 
financing and incentives help drive deployment  
Innovative financing models, such as those available in the United Kingdom, Brazil 
(São Paulo), and Chile (Santiago), are also helping to drive up sales. In Santiago, 
for example, buses have been leased to the operator as opposed to traditional 
ownership, lowering the upfront cost, which can present a significant barrier to 
deployment. The scheme benefitted from investment by the International Finance

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Corporation (IFC). A similar model is being explored for collaboration between the 
IFC and Transvolt in India to help deploy 8 000 battery electric buses. 
Italy, which now has the highest number of electric bus sales in the 
European Union, more than doubled its stock from 2023 to 2024, with growth 
fuelled by incentives totalling EUR 50 million made available in July 2022. As in 
other countries, the majority of electric bus registrations are intended for urban 
use. In Milan, for example, the municipal public transport operator, ATM, has 
committed to having a 100% electric fleet by 2030.  
In the United States, uptake has been greatest for school buses, which 
represented around half of the electric bus stock in 2024. As of mid-June, the 
Clean School Bus Program had funded approximately 8 100 electric school buses, 
using approximately USD 3 billion of the USD 5 billion allocated for fiscal years 
2022-2026 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Oakland, California, became 
the first school district in the United States to have a fully electric fleet in 2024. 
This contrasts starkly with the experience of New York City, which has a legally 
binding target to fully electrify its fleet of 10 000 buses by 2035, yet has deployed 
under 50 to date, partly due to difficulties in negotiating affordable purchases. 
India has seen rapid growth in electric bus deployment since 2020, with stock 
increasing from less than 3 000 to more than 11 500 at the end of 2024. A 
combination of increasingly favourable economics, available incentives and 
additional government support for charging infrastructure has enabled huge year-
on-year growth. Demand has been boosted by schemes such as the National 
Electric Bus Programme, which targets deploying a further 40 000 electric buses 
by 2027, helping to generate large orderbooks and use aggregated procurement 
to drive down costs. This is further strengthened by new schemes such as PM E-
DRIVE, which could support sales of a further 14 028 electric buses, with 
preference given to replacements of old public buses. The forthcoming Bharat 
Urban Megabus Mission aims to introduce 100 000 electric buses to cities with a 
population of over 1 million.  
China’s electric bus sales strengthen, but Chinese OEMs are 
also focusing on exports 
China has the world’s highest stock share of electric buses, at 30%, compared to 
2% across Europe (the second-largest electric bus fleet), and this share has been 
steadily growing over the past decade. The country took an early lead in deploying 
electric buses, with almost 70% of the more than 680 000 electric buses in the 
country today having been deployed before 2020. The year 2024 saw an increase 
in electric bus sales following several years of decline, potentially reflecting the 
replacement of older electric buses in cities such as Shenzhen, which fully 
electrified their bus fleets years ago. The introduction of a national-level city bus 
scrappage scheme announced in January 2025 looks likely to further support the 
uptick in sales seen in 2024.

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Chinese manufacturers have also been increasingly looking to exports to exploit 
their available manufacturing capacity. In 2024, more than 15 000 electric buses 
were exported from China, over 25% more than in 2023. BYD and Foton are some 
of China’s leading manufacturers of electric buses, and together with other 
Chinese manufacturers supplied more than 80% of electric buses in Latin 
America's stock. In early 2025, the city of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, signed a 
purchase agreement for 2 000 BYD buses, 1 000 of which are set to be delivered 
by the end of the year. Chinese OEM Yutong has also seen success 
internationally, fulfilling orders in Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom, and 
solidifying their position as Europe’s best-selling electric bus brand for the third 
year in a row. Yutong has already supplied fleets to places as diverse as Chile, 
Mexico, Norway and Uzbekistan since 2020. In Qatar, 70% of the public bus fleet 
was electrified between 2021 and 2023 through a partnership with Yutong, 
supporting the government’s aim for all of its public transport buses to be electric 
by 2030. The Qatari government has also made plans for domestic production of 
electric buses in partnership with Yutong, with the aim of establishing a production 
hub for electric buses to serve international markets including Europe, the Middle 
East and North Africa, as well as meeting growing local demand.  
Global electric truck sales grew by almost 80% in 2024 
New incentives help China strengthen its lead as overall 
progress stalls in Europe and the United States 
Sales of electric medium- and heavy-duty trucks grew for the third consecutive 
year in 2024 to exceed 90 000 worldwide. Year-on-year growth was almost 80%, 
a stark contrast to the decline in sales seen between 2018 and 2021. This spurt 
was largely a result of Chinese sales more than doubling between 2023 and 2024 
– more than 80% of all electric trucks sold globally in 2024 were sold in China.  
Strong growth in China was spurred in part by a vehicle scrappage scheme 
including purchase incentives, which is being renewed in 2025. Falling battery 
prices and the introduction of tighter emission standards for trucks issued in July 
2023 further accelerated the shift. Pressure on heavy industries to reduce 
emissions is also translating into deployment of electric trucks, especially in 
heavily industrialised areas such as Hebei Province, where the fleet of electric 
trucks reached 30 000 vehicles. 
In 2024, Europe saw more than 10 000 electric trucks sold for the second year in 
a row, despite a lack of substantial incentives. Denmark, Germany, Italy, the 
United Kingdom and others saw significant growth, though this was partially offset 
by drops in electric truck sales in key markets such as France and the 
Netherlands.

In the United States, electric truck sales in 2024 were similar to in 2023. 
Nevertheless, the number of electric trucks sold in 2024 – over 1 700 – was more 
than the cumulative number of electric trucks sold in the country between 2015 
and 2022. Electric truck sales in the United States were supported by a tax credit 
of up to USD 40 000, as well as project grants for vehicle purchases, charging 
infrastructure and other expenses through the nearly USD 1 billion Clean Heavy-
Duty Vehicles Grant Program.  
There were positive developments elsewhere in the world, such as in Brazil, where 
almost 500 electric trucks were sold in 2024, and in Canada, with almost 2 000 
sales for the second year in a row. In addition, Japan, South Africa and Thailand 
saw their collective sales jump from around 130 to almost 900 between 2023 and 
2024. India saw a decline in electric truck sales in 2024, but in September the PM 
E-DRIVE scheme allocated a budget of USD 58 million for purchase incentives for 
electric trucks over the next 2 years.

Deployment of electric trucks varies by application, as some duty cycles are more 
suited to electrification than others. Cycles with combinations of lower daily 
mileage, lower speeds, and predictable routes are typically easier to electrify, as 
seen at Manhattan Beer, which has begun to electrify its fleet. In California,

destination – has lent itself to the adoption of electric trucks. Across the 
United States, yard tractors have also proven to be an early adopter.  
Similarly, in India, UltraTech Cement have ordered 100 electric trucks to 
decarbonise a 400 km route between two of their operations, and orders for 180 
electric trucks from Billion E-Mobility (including 45 with a gross vehicle weight of 
55 tonnes) have spurred Ashok Leyland to increase their production capacity. In 
China, successful battery swapping trials have supported an increase in electric 
trucks in the concrete industry.  
Efforts to switch to electric trucks for delivery services are also spurring uptake 
and trials of new heavy truck models, where high mileages increase the potential 
cost benefits of electrification. In California, DHL recently tested the prototype of 
the Tesla Semi, which is expected to enter production in 2026, while in Germany, 
DHL deployed two Mercedes eActros 300s. Similarly, Amazon signed an order for 
more than 200 Mercedes eActros-600 electric trucks, which will be deployed in 
the United Kingdom and Germany with the goal of decarbonising high-mileage 
predictable routes, on which charging can be planned with a high degree of 
certainty. These trends indicate that certain niches will become cost-competitive 
in advance of the segment at large. 
Electric heavy-duty models 
The number of electric heavy-duty vehicle models 
reached almost 800 in 2024 
The number of electric heavy-duty models available worldwide has continued to 
grow steadily, driven by increasing demand as battery costs have declined. The 
market with the most models available remains China, with almost 450 – more 
than half of which are electric buses. In the United States, over 140 models are 
available, around half of which are medium-duty truck models, while buses 
represent less than 30%. The prevalence of medium-duty models in the US market 
could suggest that fleet operators are prioritising the electrification of lower-cost 
vehicles that cover shorter routes before transitioning to long-haul applications. In 
Europe, there are about 150 electric heavy-duty models available, with a more 
even distribution across buses, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks.  
In Europe, truck OEMs are expanding their electric heavy-duty truck line-ups for 
regional-haul applications (<400 km), and improving performances for long-haul 
trucks amid increasing electric sales. In 2024, Volvo launched its latest electric 
truck, FH Electric, offering a range of 600 km, similar to the range offered by 
Scania’s latest electric truck model. On the other hand, OEMs such as Renault 
are targeting urban logistics.

Electric heavy-duty models are also becoming available in emerging markets. 
BAIC Foton has an electric truck on the market in Argentina, and German truck 
manufacturer TRATON has been producing their electric “e-Delivery” truck in 
Brazil since 2021 under the Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus brand. In 2024, 
BYD licensed Rêver to build electric buses and trucks based on BYD technologies 
in Thailand.  
Falling battery prices have been a key driver of growth in electric trucks. Since 
2020, battery prices1 for commercial vehicles have dropped by 30%, enabling 
manufacturers to either extend vehicle range without increasing costs, or reduce 
costs to narrow the price gap between diesel and electric trucks. Between 2020 
and 2024, the price of medium-duty electric truck battery packs increased only 
slightly, by almost 15%, despite battery size increasing by more than 60%. For 
heavy-duty trucks, battery pack size increased by around 70% between 2020 and 
2024, but falling battery prices meant the rise in battery pack costs per vehicle was 
limited to less than 20% over the same period. Strategic partnerships between 
battery and commercial vehicle manufacturers, such as the agreement between 
CATL and FAW, seek to deliver even more affordable electric truck models 
through a more integrated supply chain.

Truck total cost of ownership  
For electric trucks to reach mass adoption, the total cost of owning an electric truck 
must be able to compete with the cost of owning a traditional diesel truck. 
Commercial vehicle owners and operators are typically more sensitive to the total 
cost of ownership (TCO) than personal car buyers, though higher upfront purchase 
costs can, of course, still present a hurdle.  
The TCO of a vehicle depends on how the vehicle is used, and on the capital, 
energy and labour costs, all of which vary by region. Long-haul, heavy-duty trucks 
are often considered one of the hardest-to-electrify vehicle segments due to the 
need to balance battery size, range and payload constraints with charging 
requirements. In this section, we consider battery electric and fuel cell electric 
heavy-duty (HD) trucks, both of which have zero tailpipe emissions, and compare 
their TCO to diesel HD trucks in three major markets: China, the European Union 
and the United States.2 A daily driving distance of 500 km is assumed. 
The upfront cost of a battery electric truck was two to 
three times that of a diesel truck in 2024 
While the TCO is important for overall business profitability, the upfront costs can 
be particularly important to small business that may have less access to financing. 
Small businesses make up the vast majority of hauliers in the United States (95%) 
and Europe (90%), and more than half in China (less than 70%),3 where the 
haulage industry has been experiencing increasing consolidation.  
Battery electric and fuel cell electric trucks are more expensive to purchase than 
conventional diesel trucks. This is mostly due to the batteries used in BEVs and 
the fuel cell stacks and hydrogen storage tanks in FCEVs being more expensive 
than equivalent diesel ICEV technologies. Today, for a truck with an 800 kWh 
battery (500 km range), the battery represents almost half of the upfront cost of a 
battery electric truck, and this is expected to fall to around 35% in 2030. For an 
FCEV, the battery, fuel cell system and hydrogen storage tank represent around 
half of the upfront cost today and this is not expected to change in 2030.  
The costs of batteries, fuel cells, and hydrogen storage tanks are expected to fall 
thanks to greater economies of scale and manufacturing learnings, driving down 
the capital costs of both BEVs and FCEVs. In the next 5 years, the purchase price 
of a battery electric HD truck could fall by around 15-35%, depending on the 
 
 
2 Please see Annex A for full assumptions and costs used to calculate TCO in this section. 
3 Due to differences in reporting across the sources, in the case of the United States a small business is defined as having 
up to 10 trucks, in Europe up to 9, whereas in China the equivalent number is 20 or under.

region. That of a fuel cell HD truck could fall 20-25%. However, both are expected 
to remain more expensive than diesel ICE trucks at the point of purchase.  
Purchase prices vary by region, and are lowest in China, primarily due to lower 
manufacturing and battery costs. Although the absolute price difference between 
battery electric and fuel cell electric trucks versus diesel equivalents is smallest in 
China, the low cost of diesel trucks means it has the largest relative price 
differences, at almost three (for battery electric) and four (for fuel cell electric) 
times the equivalent diesel price. The United States has the highest prices overall, 
while Europe enjoys both lower-cost diesel and zero-emissions trucks. Although 
not a like-for-like comparison, real-world price data shows that the premium for a 
zero-emissions truck was around USD 60 000 higher in the United States than in 
Europe in 2024, demonstrating the difficulties the United States is facing in 
achieving price competitiveness.

Increasing the utilisation of charging infrastructure can 
significantly reduce fuel costs for battery electric trucks

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
years, vehicle efficiencies will likely improve by just 2-5%, meaning the levelised 
cost of fuel will remain a key component of TCO, especially for trucks with high 
daily driving distances. However, battery electric trucks are about 55% more 
energy-efficient than diesel heavy-duty trucks of the same size, while fuel cell 
electric trucks are about 30% more efficient. As such, based on 2024 fuel prices, 
the direct fuel costs associated with operating a battery electric heavy-duty truck 
are almost 70% lower than the diesel equivalent in China, and about one-third 
lower in the European Union and the United States.  
However, unlike diesel, both BEVs and FCEVs require the buildout of new, 
relatively expensive infrastructure, which adds to the fuel costs. Further, the 
levelised cost of both EV chargers and hydrogen refuelling stations (HRSs) is 
highly affected by utilisation rates. Overall, truck charging infrastructure could 
reach even higher levels of utilisation than LDV chargers, given that logistics 
operations are typically planned according to a predetermined schedule. 
Increasing the utilisation rate of an EV charger from 5% to 30% lowers the 
levelised infrastructure cost per kWh by about 80%, which would cut the overall 
fuel cost per kilometre by half based on 2024 prices. Increasing utilisation of en 
route chargers even further is possible, but may require solutions such as adaptive 
route planning.  
While a single HRS is more costly to build than a charging point, it can serve a 
large number of trucks daily without the local grid impacts of high-powered 
chargers. As the utilisation rises from 30% to 80%, the hydrogen cost premium for 
infrastructure investment payment drops by nearly 60%, resulting in a 25% drop 
in overall fuel cost per kilometre. However, even at higher utilisation rates, such 
as for captive fleets (i.e. that are owned by the operators and return to depot) or 
on busy public routes, the energy plus infrastructure cost per kilometre remains 
about 5% higher than EV charging at low utilisation rates, and double the cost of 
EV charging at high utilisation rates.  
For every USD 1 million spent on infrastructure, a highly utilised 350 kW charger 
covers more than twice as many vehicle kilometres as a highly utilised HRS. In 
addition, HRSs may present a greater barrier to entry, as they cannot be easily 
phased in gradually: an investment in HRSs must be accompanied by a large 
investment in FCEVs to avoid prohibitive per-vehicle fuel and infrastructure costs. 
On the other hand, chargers can be built modularly and more easily scaled as the 
fleet grows, beginning with depot charging, with en route high-powered charging 
following later to enable a greater share of journeys to be electrified.  
Policies such as the EU Renewable Energy Directive, California’s Low Carbon 
Fuel Standard, or China’s multiple cross-cutting policies promote reductions in 
emissions associated with electricity and hydrogen production, but can also 
impact the future fuel costs. A smaller share of electrolysis projects reached final 
investment decision between October 2024 and October 2023 when compared to 
the previous 12 months, potentially constraining the supply of low-emissions

hydrogen, which is more expensive than the fossil-fuel derived hydrogen 
predominantly used today. Meanwhile, low-cost solar and wind are driving down 
electricity grid emissions and can reduce electricity prices over time. However, 
further advances in electricity storage, smart charging and grid integration are 
needed to compensate for the intermittency of wind and solar and increase the 
benefits offered by electric trucks, requiring substantial investment.

including infrastructure, 2024   
 
 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Notes: “Fuel” represents the average price a truck operator pays, including taxes for each fuel. For hydrogen, the cost is 
the weighted levelised cost of production from all sources, meaning it is dominated by unabated steam methane reforming, 
plus the cost of distribution to the refuelling station. For electricity and hydrogen, “Infrastructure cost” is the annualised cost 
per unit of fuel/energy delivered, assuming a 10-year lifetime and 8% discount rate. For diesel, it is 2% of the fuel price. 
The “low infrastructure utilisation” factors are 5% for the 350 kW charger and 30% for the hydrogen refuelling station; the 
“high infrastructure utilisation” case assumes 30% utilisation of EV charger and 80% utilisation of the hydrogen refuelling 
station, which results in a reduced the cost per unit of energy delivered by serving a greater number of vehicles. Please see

Battery electric trucks become competitive for long-haul 
applications this decade in China and Europe 
For a diesel HD truck that travels an average 500 km per day, the truck capital 
cost represents only around 10% of the TCO across China, Europe and the 
United States. That means that outside of relatively fixed costs such as driver 
costs, insurance and maintenance, diesel fuel costs dominate the TCO. In 
comparison, for an 800 kWh battery electric truck, the cost of the truck represents 
about 20-25% of the TCO, demonstrating the potential trade-off between high 
upfront costs and lower running costs. For battery electric trucks, energy costs 
account for around 15-25% of the TCO, and for fuel cell trucks they account for 
15-35%, across the three regions examined. For BEVs, more than 10% of the 
TCO can be attributed to charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States,

while in China, this share is reduced to around 3%, thanks to lower industrial land 
costs as well as lower capital costs. The refuelling infrastructure for fuel cell trucks 
has higher costs, representing nearly 10% of the TCO in China and more than 
15% in Europe and the United States.  
In terms of operations, regulations on truck driver rest periods can play a role in 
determining the cost of the “dwell” time for recharging electric truck batteries. The 
time associated with charging is often considered to be a barrier to the adoption 
of battery electric trucks for long-haul applications as it can potentially disrupt 
operations, especially in very long-haul applications. This consideration is factored 
into the TCO calculation by adding the additional labour cost for the truck driver. 
In the European Union, drivers are required to take a 45-minute break every 
4.5 hours. In the United States, a driver is not permitted to drive for more than 
8 hours without a 30-minute break. In China, drivers are required to take a break 
every 4 hours, generally 20 minutes. As such, driving regulations can influence 
the TCO, and making use of rest periods for charging can make battery electric 
trucks more or less cost-competitive with diesel trucks. Based on a 500 km daily 
route and current regulations, an extra 15 (European Union), 30 (United States), 
and 40 minutes (China) would be needed in addition to the driver rest period in 
order to charge the battery electric HD truck sufficiently.4 The net cost associated 
with dwell time represents a trade-off between the fuel and labour costs, and as 
such may make more economic sense in China, where diesel is more expensive 
than in other regions, and labour and electricity less expensive. In contrast, in the 
United States, lower costs for diesel and higher labour and electricity costs can 
make it more difficult to justify.  
Charger power is also key in calculating this trade-off. A 350 kW charger, as used 
in the base case, can provide 200 km of range in around 1 hour, while a 1 MW 
charger could provide the same in about 20 minutes, potentially eliminating the 
dwell cost.5 Destination charging, particularly where drivers must wait for loading 
and unloading, could also greatly reduce the dwell time.  
The impact on payload is another consideration for many hauliers. In the 
United States, 18% of trucks operate close to the general maximum gross vehicle 
weight, with a further 7% operating above the limit, meaning they could be 
impacted by the additional weight of either a fuel cell or battery electric truck 
compared to diesel. Derogations exist in the United States (907 kg) and the 
European Union (2 000 kg) to help offset the impact of the additional weight. A 
proposal from the European Commission to further increase this to 4 000 kg could 
eliminate the disadvantage relative to diesel trucks, but could also marginally 
 
 
4 500 km daily distance is split evenly before and after the minimum rest periods of 20, 30, and 45 minutes in China, the 
United States, and the European Union, respectively, based on the driver’s rest regulations for each country/region, after 
which drivers, if required, continue to use the 350 kW charger to provide sufficient range to perform the same daily mileage 
day after day, including for overnight depot charging, based on 2024 fuel economy values and minimum and maximum 
battery states of charge of 20% and 80%.

increase road maintenance costs. 6 In China, industry stakeholders have also 
mooted increasing the weight limits as a means of making alternatively fuelled 
vehicles more competitive. These potential impacts are considered in the

In China, the TCO of battery electric HD trucks is already lower than that of diesel 
trucks in a number of applications. This reflects the lower cost of EV batteries in 
China, as well as the gap in fuel costs, as electricity already costs 65% less than 
diesel per kilometre. As such, energy costs for battery electric trucks are over 50% 
lower per kilometre compared to diesel trucks. Fuel cell trucks remained around 
35% more expensive than diesel trucks in China in 2024, largely because of the 
higher infrastructure and fuel costs for hydrogen.  
In the United States, higher electricity and infrastructure costs than Europe or 
China mean that the TCO of a diesel truck is almost 20% cheaper than that of a

battery electric truck, though higher charger utilisation rates could reverse this by 
2030. Compared to the European Union, US regulations on driver rest periods and 
maximum gross vehicle weight further hamper the uptake of zero-emissions trucks. 
However, in the coming years, the TCO of battery and fuel cell electric trucks is 
expected to fall due to improvements in infrastructure utilisation and costs, as well 
as further cost reductions for batteries and fuel cells. In contrast, diesel electric 
trucks are expected to become more expensive due to more stringent pollutant 
emissions regulation.  
In all three markets, fuel cell trucks remain more expensive than battery electric 
trucks up to 2030, while continued development of high-powered charging – 
especially megawatt charging – reduces or eliminates the refuelling time 
advantage offered by FCEVs compared to BEVs. Increased utilisation of HRSs 
could result in further reductions to the TCO of fuel cell electric trucks, but battery 
electric trucks will remain cheaper to operate. For fuel cell electric trucks to 
become more competitive, substantial reductions in the capital costs of the truck 
and infrastructure, as well as lower fuel costs, will be necessary.  
In 2030, the TCO of battery electric trucks is more competitive than diesel trucks 
in both China and the European Union. The gap also narrows substantially in the 
United States, achieving parity around 2030. Incentives such as grants towards 
the purchase of trucks, chargers, or HRSs, or differentiated taxes and charges 
could bring this date even closer, or indeed allow TCO parity to be achieved today 
in applications particularly suited to electrification.

Sales of fuel cell trucks and buses outpaced sales of fuel cell cars in 2024 
In 2024, the stock of fuel cell vehicles grew to over 100 000, 15% more than the 
year before. In comparison, the stock of EVs exceeded 60 million (excluding 2/3Ws) 
at the end of 2024, about 600 times the number of FCEVs. About 70% of the FCEVs 
on the road are cars, though this share has fallen since the end of 2023 (75%). Fuel 
cell trucks experienced higher growth in 2024 than fuel cell cars or buses, with the 
stock increasing by more than 40% compared to 2023.

Growth in fuel cell car sales has slowed in recent years, with just 5 000 sold 
worldwide in 2024, compared to the peak of more than 16 000 in 2021. This 
slowdown is particularly acute in the United States and Korea – the two countries 
with the largest stocks of fuel cell cars. In California, where the majority of US fuel 
cell cars are sold, only around 600 new fuel cell cars were registered in 2024 – the 
lowest number since 2015. In Korea, almost 3 000 fuel cell cars were sold in 2024, 
about 35% less than in 2023 and 70% less than in 2022. Only a handful of OEMs 
produced fuel cell cars in 2024.  
In contrast, the global stock of fuel cell buses grew by almost 20% in 2024. China 
continues to have the most fuel cell buses, accounting for three-quarters of the 
global stock. The number of fuel cell buses grew strongly in Korea in 2024 to reach 
a stock of 1 000, about 10% of the global total.  
Unlike Korea, the United States and Japan – each of which has traditionally focused 
more on fuel cell car deployment than on any other segment – over 70% of the 
FCEV stock in China is commercial vehicles (including LCVs and heavy trucks). In 
China, cars make up only around 3% of the total fuel cell vehicle fleet, while in the

United States and Korea they account for up to 97%. In 2024, the stock of fuel cell 
trucks in China increased 40% compared to 2023, reaching almost 15 000 vehicles, 
about 5 times the amount at the end of 2020. In addition, the stock of fuel cell LCVs 
in China reached more than 5 000 by the end of 2024, nearly double that of the 
previous year. Almost 95% of the world’s fuel cell commercial vehicles are in China.  
Around 50 fuel cell commercial vehicle models were available worldwide in 2024. 
Over 60% of these were heavy-duty truck models, coming from 20 different 
manufacturers. However, Nikola, one of the pioneers of heavy-duty fuel cell trucks, 
filed for bankruptcy in February 2025, despite selling 200 vehicles in 2024 and 
securing orders for 100 more meant to be delivered in 2025.  
To support the growing number of FCEVs, countries have supported the buildout of 
hydrogen refuelling stations (HRSs). The number of operational stations reached 
around 1 300 worldwide at the end of 2024, 15% more than at the end of 2023. The 
largest growth occurred in China, where the number of HRSs increased 30% in 
2024 to reach more than 500. In Europe, the number of stations increased 15% to 
over 300 by the end of 2024, despite some closures in countries such as Denmark 
and the United Kingdom. The United States and Korea have also seen the number 
of available HRSs fluctuate over the past year or so, as hydrogen supply and station 
reliability issues have led to temporary and permanent closures. The number of 
operational HRSs in the United States increased in 2024, but remains below the 
number available between 2017 and 2022.

The number of FCEVs per HRS is significantly higher in the United States and 
Korea than in other regions. The global average number of FCEVs per HRS has 
remained at under 80 over the past 5 years, while in the United States this ratio 
exceeded 300 in 2023 and 2024 and has been close to 200 in Korea since 2020.

5. Outlook for electric mobility 
Overview 
In this part of the report, we focus on the outlook for electric mobility in road 
transport over the period to 2030. A scenario-based approach is used to explore 
the prospects for electric mobility, based on recent market trends, policy drivers 
and technology developments.  
The purpose of scenario projections is to assess a plausible future for global 
electric vehicle (EV) markets and the potential implications. The scenario 
projections are not intended as predictions about the future. Rather, they aim to 
provide insights to inform decision-making by governments, companies and other 
stakeholders about the future of EVs.  
In particular, the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) reflects the current policy 
landscape, taking into account existing policies and measures, as well as those 
that are under development. It includes current EV-related policies and 
announcements, regulations and investments, as well as market trends based on 
the expected impacts of technology developments, announced deployments and 
plans from industry stakeholders. The STEPS aims to hold up a mirror to the plans 
of policy makers and illustrate their consequences.  
The projections for EV markets in this year’s Global EV Outlook (GEVO-25) are 
limited to 2030 in the STEPS. As the IEA highlighted in its 2024 edition of Energy 
Technology Perspectives, energy, industrial and trade policies are increasingly 
interwoven and there are challenges and trade-offs between these key areas of 
public policy. The way these interactions play out for electric mobility over the 
longer term will therefore be assessed holistically in the context of the scenarios 
of the entire global energy system that the IEA will develop later in the year using 
its Global Energy and Climate Model (GEC-M). Key uncertainties for EV markets 
for the medium-term – such as those related to the evolution of trade and industrial 
policy, downside risks to the economic outlook and the impact of different levels 
of oil prices – are, however, presented in this chapter of the report. 
The projections in the STEPS in GEVO-2025 consider historical market data and 
stated policies up until the end of February 2025. These scenario projections 
incorporate GDP assumptions from the International Monetary Fund and 
population assumptions from the United Nations, as described in the 2024 GEC-M 
documentation.

Explorer, which is updated with each edition of the Global EV Outlook. 
Vehicle outlook by mode 
The global electric vehicle fleet grows fourfold to 2030 
under stated policies 
By 2030, the fleet of EVs across all modes except 2/3Ws reaches 250 million in 
the STEPS – four times as many EVs as there were at the end of 2024. More than 
90% are electric cars, which is similar to the share in 2024. In this scenario, the 
stock of EVs (excluding 2/3Ws) increases at an average rate of about 25% per 
year, which is about half the annual growth observed from 2018-2024. 
In 2024, the stock of electric 2/3Ws was higher than that of all other EVs combined. 
By 2030, however, the stock of electric cars overtakes that of electric 2/3Ws, 
despite the latter more than doubling to reach around 170 million in 2030 in the 
STEPS. As a result, EVs represent about 15% of all vehicles on the road (including 
2/3Ws) in 2030 in this scenario. The share of global EV stock in China decreases 
from over 70% in 2024 to around 55% in 2030 in the STEPS as adoption in other 
markets grows.

light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and 2/3Ws reaches around 40% in the STEPS. In terms 
of stock shares, 2/3Ws remain the most electrified vehicle segment in 2030 in the 
STEPS, with around one in six 2/3Ws being electric compared to one in seven 
LDVs.  
Despite electric buses and electric LDVs having about the same stock share in 
2024, the sales share of electric buses grows more slowly, reaching less than 20% 
globally in 2030 in the STEPS. As a result, slightly more than 10% of the global 
bus stock is electric in 2030 in the STEPS.  
Trucks remain the slowest mode to electrify but make some progress thanks to 
HDV emissions standards and improving economics. In 2030, electric truck sales 
reach around 13% globally in the STEPS, though only 3% of the truck stock is 
electric at that point.

Economic and policy uncertainties could impact car 
markets and the global outlook for EVs  
The recent surge in trade policies and tariffs may affect the price and resulting 
sales of EVs – especially electric cars – in several markets over the coming years. 
In particular, in March 2025 the United States announced an additional 25% tariff 
applicable to all automobiles, including electric cars, and to certain components. 
In 2024, 40% of electric cars sold in the United States (over 600 000) were 
imported, with over 10% of them coming from Europe and slightly less than 10% 
each coming from Mexico, Japan and Korea. Conventional car sales are more 
exposed, with over half of all conventional cars sold in the United States in 2024 
having been imported. Conventional car imports generally come from the same

countries as EVs, although there is a much higher reliance on Mexico and lower 
reliance on Europe. As a result, the impact of tariffs on the sales share of electric 
cars in the United States may be relatively small compared to the impact of 
potential changes in demand-side policies (such as fuel economy standards and 
tax incentives), some of which are already considered as part of the STEPS 
outlook.  
The impact of tariffs might be more pronounced for EV batteries, their components 
and raw materials, all of which are highly traded across the world because supply 
is significantly more concentrated than demand. China produces the cheapest EV 
batteries, and was responsible for nearly 80% of global EV battery cell production 
in 2024. China’s share of production was even higher for battery components, for 
which the country represented almost 85% of global cathode active material and 
over 90% of the anode active material production. A global shift towards higher 
tariffs could put upward pressure on battery prices, counteracting some of the 
significant battery price declines that have occurred since 2015. For example, a 
25% tariff would override the 20% average battery price declines from the past 
year. However, countries across the world are simultaneously developing and 
improving the competitiveness of their local battery manufacturing industries, 
which is expected to contribute to narrowing regional cost gaps.  
Emerging trade tensions also have implications for the economic outlook, which 
may create additional uncertainty for the EV outlook. In April 2025, the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) released revised GDP projections, which show 
2.8% growth globally in 2025 and 3% growth in 2026, as compared to 3.3% in both 
years in their January 2025 projections. The revisions to GDP growth were most 
pronounced in North America, with projected 2025 growth for the United States 
falling from 2.7% previously to 1.8% in the April 2025 update. The IMF now 
projects in its central scenario that in the United States and China, two of the 
largest EV markets in the world, GDP growth in 2025 will be one percentage point 
lower than in 2024. By 2027, the IMF expects global GDP growth to return back 
to levels previously projected, though for advanced economies as a whole, annual 
GDP growth projections remain lower through 2029 compared to the IMF’s 
October 2024 publication.  
Lower GDP growth could add pressure on already-strained government budgets, 
which, in turn, could lead to governments downscaling or terminating incentive 
schemes for EVs ahead of schedule. While direct subsidies are already quite small 
in most major markets, indirect subsidies, such as those related to company cars, 
could be affected. Similarly, budgets allocated to the deployment of charging 
infrastructure at different administrative levels (from national to local levels of 
government) could be reduced. While all these factors could slow down the uptake 
of EVs, policy responses can also be developed in a way that supports EV sales, 
as was done in European countries in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.  


Global EV Outlook 2025

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Lower economic growth and the corresponding effects on the purchasing power 
of consumers could slow down sales of new vehicles across all powertrain types, 
thereby potentially counterbalancing the impact on EV sales shares. Evidence 
shows that an economic slowdown can affect car sales. For example, pronounced 
and abrupt economic crises have led to double digit declines in car sales in the 
past, for example in the United States between 2007 and 2009 (GDP -2.5%, car 
sales -37%), and in Italy between 2011 and 2013 (GDP -5%, car sales -25%). 
More modest and gradual economic slowdowns can also have an effect, such as 
the slowdown in China between 2017 and 2019 (+6.2 % compared to a ten-year 
average of over +8%) that led to the first decline in car sales recorded in decades, 
of -12% over 2 years.  
The extent to which car markets – and, as part of that, electric car sales – might 
be affected by a sluggish economic outlook is still uncertain. The Chinese market 
will be key to watch: it is the largest single car market in the world, and it drives 
the outlook for global electric car sales in the medium term, accounting for more 
than half of global electric car sales through 2030 in the STEPS. In China, electric 
cars are already price competitive with conventional cars and so there is little 
reason to believe that electric car sales would be more affected by an economic 
slowdown than conventional cars. Further, China’s extension of its vehicle trade-
in policy may also contribute to keeping overall car sales strong. Even if car sales 
volumes in China are lower than is projected in the STEPS, electric car sales 
shares are likely to remain relatively robust.  
Finally, changes in energy prices can also affect the adoption of EVs. Weak 
demand prospects have led to a drop in global oil prices from an average of around 
USD 80 per barrel in 2024 to below USD 60 per barrel at one point in April 2025. 
Lower oil prices, if sustained, could translate into lower retail prices for gasoline 
and diesel, thus reducing the economic incentive to purchase EVs, all else being 
equal. The impact of such a drop is likely to vary across regions: it will be more 
moderate in regions with high fuel taxation (such as the European Union), and 
more pronounced in regions with lower fuel taxation, such as the United States 
and China. Nonetheless, oil prices would need to be extremely low to completely 
offset the savings offered by the lower running costs of EVs.  
Taking oil prices around USD 40 per barrel as an illustrative example, there are 
significant savings to be made in all major markets from running a battery electric 
car if it is charged at home. In China, even at such a low oil price, battery electric 
cars remain cheaper to run when charged at public fast chargers due to a 
combination of low electricity prices and high charging infrastructure utilisation 
rates. In the United States, the vast majority of electric car owners have access to 
home charging, but public fast charging can be expensive compared to gasoline. 
In the European Union, most EV owners also have access to home chargers, 
though to a lesser extent. Low oil prices could therefore undermine the economic 
case for EVs for drivers without access to home charging depending on the speed 
and thus cost of public charging.

Market momentum in China sees electric cars reach a 
sales share of around 80% by the end of the decade 
In the second half of 2024, China achieved the milestone of an electric car sales 
share of more than 50%, partly thanks to the cost competitiveness of EVs. For the 
past few years, over half of the electric cars sold in China have been cheaper than 
ICE cars of the same size, and as battery prices continue to fall, this trend is likely 
to continue. 
Based on stated policies, the share of electric cars and vans in China is expected 
to reach around 80% of total sales in 2030, backed by continuing policy support 
and progress on affordability. China has already exceeded the official government 
target of reaching a sales share of 45% of new energy vehicles (NEV) among new 
cars by 2027, underscoring the strong market dynamics behind the shift to 
electromobility. Trade-in grants that were due to expire at the end of 2024 have 
been extended to 2025, and the NEV exemption from vehicle purchase tax has 
also been extended until the end of 2027, further supporting uptake of EVs in the 
short term. In addition, government plans to enhance charging infrastructure over 
the period to 2030 aim to keep pace with EV uptake by promoting the construction 
of charging stations in residential areas, as well as in parking spaces in 
enterprises, industrial parks and government buildings. 
Policy action to restrict ICE 2/3Ws in several cities over the past decade has driven 
high adoption rates of electric 2/3Ws, with more than 30% of 2/3Ws now electric. 
In the STEPS, the share of electric 2/3Ws on the road reaches nearly 50% by 
2030, driven by the continued momentum of electromobility in China and a further 
decline in battery costs. 
This growing trend also extends to buses, especially in cities, where nearly all new 
buses are now electric. However, the electric market share of coaches for intercity 
transport was below 10% in 2024. By 2030 in the STEPS, the sales share of 
electric buses reaches almost 75% across all bus segments, up from less than 
two-thirds today. 
China currently accounts for more than 80% of electric medium- and heavy-duty 
truck sales worldwide, and the sales share in the country increased to more than 
4% in 2024, from 2% in 2023. In some months, the sales share of battery-electric 
heavy trucks reached a new high of almost 15%, as seen in late June. Truck 
manufacturers are making efforts to reduce costs, such as by adopting the less 
costly lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry. In addition, policy support 
for HDV charging infrastructure and the increasing availability of battery-swap-
capable vehicles could further accelerate electrification in this segment. Although 
the upfront cost is higher today compared to diesel powertrains, the annual 
savings from significantly lower fuel costs mean that electric medium- and heavy-

freight trucks become a cost-competitive option in many applications in the short-
term (see Truck total cost of ownership in Section 4). By 2030, the sales share of 
electric trucks exceeds 30% in the STEPS. 
Given China's strong position in the shift towards electromobility, the sales share 
of EVs across all vehicle types (excluding 2/3Ws) reaches close to 80% by 2030 
in the STEPS, well on track with what is needed for its target of reaching climate 
neutrality in 2060 and supporting efforts to reduce air pollution. 
European policy environment continues to promote EVs 
while offering some flexibility in the short term 
Electric car sales stagnated in Europe in 2024, due to a mix of factors including 
reduced availability of purchase subsidies and a lack of affordable mass-market 
EV models in OEMs line-ups, as well as sluggish car markets in general. 
Nonetheless, the policy environment in Europe is one of the strongest in terms of 
support for EVs, which could encourage strong growth in electric LDV sales over 
the remainder of this decade. OEMs are beginning to introduce more competitively 
priced models to comply with the new phase of EU CO2 standards, which entered 
into force in 2025. 
The 2025-2029 EU fleet-wide CO2 targets that were originally proposed represent 
a 15% emissions reduction compared to a 2021 baseline. The stringency of the 
standard is further bolstered by two changes in the way CO2 emissions are 
calculated starting from 2025. First, the utility factor (the share of distance driven 
in electric mode only) of new PHEV models, which is used to calculate their official 
CO2 emission values, decreases, meaning PHEV sales are now less effective in 
helping OEMs reach target compliance. Second, the revised calculation of CO2 
emission targets will be more favourable to smaller, lighter OEM fleets, potentially 
increasing the challenge for manufacturers of heavier models. 
As a response to concerns that compliance would be difficult for some European 
manufacturers, the European Commission recently published an Industrial Action 
Plan for the European automotive sector, which announced a proposal to offer 
flexibilities in meeting the 2025 CO2 standards for cars and vans. This allows 
OEMs to reach target compliance by averaging their emissions over the period 
2025-27, rather than needing to reach the target by the end of 2025. Despite giving 
more leeway to carmakers to fall in line with their CO2 targets, the Action Plan has 
reaffirmed the overall impetus towards the 2030 and 2035 targets. It was also 
announced that the review of the 2035 targets would be sped up, with full 
technology neutrality as a core principle, though the outcome and thus impact on 
EV shares remains to be seen.  


Global EV Outlook 2025 
Outlook for electric mobility

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
The European Union is also exploring measures to accelerate the adoption of 
zero-emission vehicles in corporate fleets, which currently account for around 60% 
of new car sales. Policies to support EV uptake in EU member states include 
national-level measures such as tax credits for EV company cars in countries 
including Belgium, or France’s "social leasing” schemes for low-income 
households, which will be rerun in 2025. When considered alongside the zero 
emission vehicle mandate in the United Kingdom, stated policies drive the sales 
share of electric cars and vans in Europe to nearly 60% by 2030 in the STEPS, 
up from less than 20% today.  
For buses and medium- and heavy-duty trucks, the EU HDV CO2 standards serve 
as the key lever for further electrification. Policy momentum is particularly strong 
for electric buses in the European Union, and their share in total bus sales reaches 
around two-thirds by 2030 in the STEPS. For medium- and heavy-freight trucks, 
policies already in place towards meeting the EU CO2 standards result in around 
one-third of new registrations in the European Union being electric by 2030 in the 
STEPS. The European Commission’s proposal to exempt zero-emission trucks 
from road tolls could further support this trend. Toll charges for a long-haul diesel 
truck can amount to EUR 25 000 annually. Across Europe as a whole, the share 
of electric medium- and heavy-duty trucks in this scenario is around 25% in 2030, 
reflecting the varying levels of policy support across different countries. 
In Europe, EV sales across all vehicle types (excluding 2/3Ws) are projected to 
exceed 55% by 2030 in the STEPS, with lighter vehicles such as passenger cars 
and light commercial vehicles making up the majority of sales. 
Recent US policy directs the government to reduce 
support for EVs  
On 20 January 2025, Executive Order 14154 declared that it was US policy to, 
among other things, eliminate subsidies and other policy measures influencing 
markets in favour of EVs. Following this, a bill was introduced to the US Senate 
that proposes to repeal the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit for both electric cars and 
commercial vehicles. In addition, the US Secretary of Transportation has directed 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to review existing fuel economy 
standards for LDVs. The fuel economy standards that were finalised in 2024 
require the fuel economy of passenger cars to improve around 2% per year for 
model years 2027-2031. 
While emissions from vehicles are typically regulated at the federal level under the 
Clean Air Act, in December 2024, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
granted California’s request for a waiver from federal pre-emption (by which 
federal law supersedes conflicting state law) for their Advanced Clean Cars II

(ACC-II) regulation. The ACC-II regulation requires an increasing number of 
electric and fuel cell electric new car sales, from 35% in 2026 to 100% in 2035 and 
beyond. In 2024, California represented almost 30% of US electric car sales, but 
only around 10% of total US car sales. In addition to California, 11 other states 
and Washington DC have adopted the ACC-II regulation under Section 177 of the 
Clean Air Act. All together, the states that have adopted the ACC-II regulation 
represent about 30% of all US LDV sales. However, Executive Order 14154 also 
directed US policy to terminate, “where appropriate, state emissions waivers that 
function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles.” Based on stated policy 
intentions, electric LDV sales in the United States increase from about 10% today 
to about 20% in 2030 in the STEPS. To put this in context, in the STEPS of GEVO-
24, US electric car sales reached more than 50% in 2030, on the back of policies 
in support of EVs. 
The availability and stringency of fuel economy and emissions standards also has 
significant implications for HDV electrification prospects in the United States. In 
April 2023, the US EPA granted a waiver of pre-emption for California’s Advanced 
Clean Trucks (ACT) Regulation, which requires that manufacturers produce and 
sell increasing quantities of medium- and heavy-duty near-zero and zero-emission 
vehicles. Ten states have since adopted the ACT regulation. On the other hand, 
California withdrew its request for a waiver of pre-emption for the Advanced Clean 
Fleets (ACF) Regulation, which would have required certain fleet owners to 
purchase increasing shares of near-zero and zero-emission trucks. Some 
elements of the ACF Regulation would not have been affected by the waiver and 
so state and local government fleets will still be required to comply with the 
regulation. At the federal level, in March 2024, the US EPA released final 
emissions standards for HDVs, which require CO2 emissions reductions (per ton-
mile) of about 25-60% for model year 2032 trucks compared to model year 2027, 
depending on truck type.  
Given uncertainty in the longevity of the existing emissions standards and state 
waivers, the sales share of electric medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the 
United States reaches around 8% in 2030 in the STEPS, up from less than half a 
percent in 2024. This compares to 20% electric truck sales projected in 2030 in 
the STEPS of GEVO-24.  
Electric bus deployment has historically been supported at the federal level 
through funding opportunities such as the Clean School Bus Program, but city and 
state policy also play a role in driving uptake, meaning that electric buses may be 
relatively insulated from changes to federal policies. For example, the Illinois State 
Legislature passed law that transit agencies in the state can purchase only zero-
emission buses from 2026. The California state government also offers incentives 
for the purchase of buses and dedicated charging infrastructure, such as the

USD 500 million allocated to school buses during the 2023-2024 fiscal year. In the 
STEPS, EVs represent close to 15% of bus sales in 2030, up from about 3% in 
2024.  
Across all vehicle types, excluding 2/3Ws, EVs represent one in five vehicles sold 
in the United States in 2030 in the STEPS, meaning one in thirteen vehicles on 
the road in 2030 is electric. This is about half the sales share across the rest of 
the world, where around 40% of vehicle sales (excluding 2/3Ws) are electric in 
2030 in the STEPS. 
Strong domestic industry, fuel economy standards and 
targeted subsidies support EV growth in Japan 
The policy framework in Japan has remained fairly stable over the past year. In 
2019, the country published LDV fuel economy targets for 2030, aiming to achieve 
an improvement of 32% in fuel economy by 2030 compared to 2016. This 11-year 
lead time has given automakers time to incorporate the fuel economy standards 
in their company strategies, and the seven largest Japanese automakers now all 
have electrification targets in place. 
In addition, purchase subsidies are available for electric and fuel cell cars to help 
achieve the country’s net zero and Green Transformation target of 100% 
electrified (including fuel cell and hybrid) car sales by 2035. In the STEPS, Japan’s 
electric LDV sales increase from 3% of total LDV sales in 2024 to 20% by 2030. 
This is in line with the low end of the range described in Japan’s Next-Generation 
Vehicle Strategy, which aims for a 20-30% sales share of electric LDVs by 2030, 
with another 30-40% sales being hybrids, and 3% being fuel cell LDVs. 
Fuel economy standards for HDVs, including buses and trucks, require a reduction 
in fuel consumption of more than 13% in 2025 compared to the 2015 baseline. 
Japan also has purchase subsidies in place for buses and trucks to support EV 
and FCEV uptake. Electric bus sales reach about 12% in 2030 in the STEPS, up 
from 2% in 2024. Electric medium and heavy freight truck sales are slow but rise 
from less than 0.5% today to around 10% by the end of the decade. 
Japan is steadily moving towards the electrification of 2/3Ws, with electric 2/3Ws 
already accounting for 7% of sales in 2024. This is further supported by city-level 
policies, such as Tokyo’s subsidies for eligible 2/3Ws, which have been introduced 
with the aim of all new sales being electric by 2035. The share of electric 2/3Ws 
continues to rise in the STEPS, reaching more than 45% by 2030. 
Japan’s EV sales share across all modes (excluding 2/3Ws) was at 3% in 2024 
and increases to nearly 20% by 2030 in the STEPS, and just slightly over 20% 
when including 2/3Ws. As a result, about 1 in 20 vehicles in Japan is electric in 
2030 based on stated policies.

Policy support in India focuses on the electrification of 
vehicles other than cars 
Following years of support under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of 
Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme, which was introduced in 2015, implementation 
of the new PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM 
E-DRIVE) scheme began on 1 October 2024. The new scheme focuses on electric 
2/3Ws, buses, trucks and charging infrastructure, while specifically excluding 
electric cars, and has a budget envelope of USD 1.3 billion to 31 March 2026.  
The 2/3W segment is already the most electrified segment in India, with close to 
10% of sales in 2024 being electric. This high electrification rate has been driven 
by the significant savings on total cost of ownership (TCO) offered by existing 
electric 2/3W models in India. As early as 2023, we estimated that, with subsidies 
in place, the TCO of an average electric 2W would be 40% less than its ICE 
equivalent after 5 years of ownership. The combination of policy support and 
advantageous economics mean that momentum in electric 2/3W sales is set to 
continue, and electric models are expected to account for more than one-third of 
2/3W sales by 2030 in the STEPS.  
Although there are no purchase subsidies for electric cars in India, other 
mechanisms may support adoption. These include the national vehicle scrapping 
policy (V-VMP), along with a number of federal and state-level policies, such as a 
reduction in the rate of the federal Good and Services Tax and in the Regional 
Transport Office state-level tax, as well as other registration and road tax waivers. 
In addition, the government’s Production Linked Incentive scheme for Automobile 
and Auto Components and for manufacturing of Advanced Chemistry Cell Battery 
Storage aims to attract investments in domestic EV and battery manufacturing. In 
March 2024, the government approved the Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of 
Electric Passenger Cars in India to attract investment from global EV 
manufacturers. This allows EV manufacturers committing to invest in India to 
import electric cars with import duties reduced from 70% (or 100% if the purchase 
price exceeds USD 50 000) to 15%. These policies in support of domestic 
manufacturing are well-poised to help drive EV uptake. 
The Indian Government is currently drafting new CO2 emissions standards for 
cars, CAFE III (2027-2032) and CAFE IV (2033-2037), which have proposed 
WLTP CO2 emission targets of 91.7 g CO2/km and 70 g CO2/km, respectively. This 
standard will be implemented with a super-credit mechanism, making it easier for 
OEMs to reach compliance through electric car sales rather than through sales of 
conventional cars and non-plug-in hybrids. Based on existing policy support

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
(excluding the latest CAFE III and IV proposals which are still at the consultation 
stage), sales of electric cars increase from 2% in 2024 to almost 15% in 2030 in 
the STEPS.  
In October 2024, the government of India also adopted the PM e-Bus Sewa-PSM 
Scheme to support the roll-out of 38 000 electric buses across the country, with a 
budget of INR 34.4 billion (USD 394 million). When considered alongside the 
support from the PM E-DRIVE scheme, electric bus sales reach 25% in 2030 in 
the STEPS, up from less than 6% in 2024. Electrification of other heavy vehicles, 
namely freight trucks, is expected to proceed less quickly, due to greater price 
barriers. Electric truck sales reach around 2% in 2030 in the STEPS, which is 
similar to India’s 2024 EV sales share for cars. 
Across all vehicle modes, excluding 2/3Ws, EVs represent 1 in 8 vehicles sold in 
India in 2030 in the STEPS, up from less than 1 in 50 in 2024. When 2/3Ws are 
included, stated policies imply that the electrification rate increases to one in three 
vehicles sold by 2030. 
EV sales in Southeast Asia approach 30% of all vehicle 
sales in 2030 under today’s policy settings  
Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s second-largest car market, has introduced a range 
of policies to meet its ambitious EV targets. One of the key incentives was the 
introduction in April 2023 of a VAT discount on EV sales, which is continuing in 
2025. In addition, EV manufacturing and trade policies currently provide import 
duty exemptions for EVs made by manufacturers committing to establish domestic 
manufacturing facilities by 2026. Under stated policies, the electric car sales share 
reaches 25% by 2030, up from 9% in 2024. This translates into a stock of almost 
1 million electric cars in 2030 in the STEPS, which is still less than half of the 
government’s target of 2 million. The country has also set the target of 13 million 
electric motorcycles by 2030. Based on recent market trends, the EV share of 
2/3W sales in Indonesia increases from less than 2% in 2024 to 30% in 2030. 
Despite this strong growth, the total stock of electric 2/3Ws is less than the 
government target for electric motorcycles.  
Several other Southeast Asian countries have recently adopted manufacturing 
and trade policies to facilitate EV imports while also developing domestic EV 
manufacturing. In most of these countries, such policy developments are 
accompanied by measures to support EV uptake. In Malaysia, for example, the 
largest car market in the region in 2024, electric cars are exempt from import 
duties, registration and road taxes until the end of 2025, and until 2027 if locally 
built. Thailand, Southeast Asia’s third-largest car market in 2024, implemented a 
set of measures called the EV 3.5 Policy to support the roll-out of electric 
passenger cars, pick-up trucks and motorcycles. This new scheme, adopted in 


Global EV Outlook 2025 
Outlook for electric mobility

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
2024, is designed as the continuation of the previous EV 3.0 Policy, while at the 
same time giving BEV manufacturers more time to meet their production 
commitments under the 3.0 version to help avoid oversupply. The Thai 
government will establish new purchase subsidies and road tax exemptions until 
2027 under the new framework, including some incentives also for hybrid vehicles, 
along with waivers on import duties for OEMs committing to produce EVs 
domestically. The Philippines, Viet Nam and Singapore have also adopted 
policies to reduce import duties, exempt EVs from excise taxes, or set up EV 
mandates to further support the adoption of EVs in the region.  
The outlook for EV sales in Southeast Asia is bright, thanks to its emerging role 
as a manufacturing hub, and the existing set of manufacturing, trade and demand-
side policies supporting the electrification of road transport. Under stated policies, 
electric car sales in Southeast Asia are likely to reach 25% of total car sales by 
2030. Other vehicle modes are also expected to make significant strides in 
electrification, with electric 2/3Ws surpassing a 30% sales share and electric 
buses nearing 15%. Overall, across all vehicle segments, the EV sales share in 
Southeast Asia approaches 30% in 2030 in the STEPS.  
Policy support in Latin America means electric bus sales 
could increase more than tenfold by 2030  
Countries in Latin America have been increasing their policy support for EVs, 
especially since 2020. In particular, Brazil, Colombia and Chile stand out for 
passing legislation to promote EVs. This is important for the EV outlook in the 
region as together, these three countries represent almost half of Latin America’s 
car and bus sales. 
In 2024, Brazil approved the MOVER programme, which incentivises private 
sector investment in the R&D and manufacturing of sustainable vehicle 
technologies including EVs. Colombia also has relevant legislation, particularly to 
encourage the electrification of public buses, including a law that requires cities 
with mass transportation systems to ensure that electric or zero-emission vehicle 
sales increase from 10% in 2025 to 100% in 2035. In 2024, the government also 
created the Fund for the Promotion of Technological Advancement, which among 
other things will support electric LDV sales by covering the price differential with 
ICEVs. In 2024, new LDV fuel economy standards came into effect in Chile. These 
promote zero-emission vehicles by offering credit multipliers. Other countries in 
Latin America also offer policy support for EVs, mainly in the form of tax incentives. 
Electric car sales in Latin America increased from 0.3% in 2020 to around 4% in 
2024, and reach around 13% in 2030 in the STEPS. Latin America has also seen 
success in deploying electric buses, which is expected to continue: in 2030 in the 
STEPS, electric bus sales reach almost 14%, up from 2% in 2024.

Automakers’ electrification announcements 
Near- and mid-term automaker electrification targets are 
increasingly uncertain 
A number of automakers have scaled back their near-term targets for EVs over 
the past year, citing lower-than-expected consumer demand, and in the context of 
difficulties in achieving profitability with BEVs for many non-Chinese OEMs. Many, 
if not all, had previously set those targets with a degree of flexibility dependent on 
market conditions. The shifting policy landscape in some markets further 
increases uncertainty in automaker electrification targets out to 2030, though the 
outlook for electric car sales remains robust.  
General Motors (GM) – the best-selling carmaker in the United States – missed 
its goal of producing and wholesaling 200 000 EVs in North America in 2024 by 
about 5%. The company expects to produce up to 300 000 EVs in 2025, and is no 
longer reiterating its previous target of reaching an annual production capacity of 
1 million EVs by the end of 2025. Similarly, Tesla – the best-selling electric 
carmaker in the United States – dropped the goal of selling 20 million cars per 
year by 2030 from its 2023 annual impact report, despite this target having been 
included in consecutive previous reports. The uncertainty around whether Tesla 
will still aim to sell 20 million electric cars worldwide in 2030 has a significant 
impact on the range of OEM electrification targets in all of the major markets.  
In 2021, Ford, GM and Stellantis released a joint statement announcing their 
aspiration to achieve sales of 40-50% electric or fuel cell electric cars in the 
United States by 2030, in line with the Biden administration’s target. Given the 
change of administration in the United States, the future commitment to these 
targets is unclear. As such, the range of OEM declarations for electric car sales in 
the United States in 2030 now stretches from 70% electric car sales in 2030 to 
less than 30%; a year ago the lower end of the range of OEM declarations in the 
United States was around 50%. In spite of this, even if only the lower end of the 
OEM target range were to be achieved, the electric car sales share in the 
United States would almost triple by 2030.

With regards to the European market, Ford has abandoned its goal to shift entirely 
to electric sales in Europe by 2030, though in 2024 Ford was responsible for less 
than 5% of car sales in the region. Volvo Cars, also representing less than 5% of 
car sales in Europe, has also scaled down its 2030 all-electric target, allowing for 
up to 10% of its sales to be hybrids. Similarly, Renault had previously aimed for 
100% of its car sales to be electric in Europe by 2030, but in 2024 its CEO 
announced that a two-pronged approach of selling both ICE and electric cars will 
continue for the next decade. Nevertheless, the range of OEM electrification 
targets for Europe remains the highest of the major EV markets, reaching from 
over 60% to around 85% of car sales in 2030. 
In contrast, as Chinese EV sales remained strong over 2024, BYD surpassed its 
2024 sales target, which had already been increased from 3.6 million new energy 
vehicles (i.e. EVs and FCEVs) to 4 million. In total, BYD represented about 15% 
of car sales in China; all-electric car brands (including Tesla, Li Auto, NIO and 
others) together represented one-quarter of car sales in China in 2024. As a result 
of the growing success of all-electric car brands, the EV sales shares in China in 
2030 based on OEM targets has increased, despite there being no new targets 
for 2030. The range of OEM declarations for 2030 would imply a 55-80% electric 
car sales share. 
While Honda has not scaled back its long-term zero-emission vehicle targets 
(100% of sales by 2040), it has announced the aim to double hybrid car sales by 
2030. Indian OEM Tata has reduced its 2030 BEV sales target from 50% to 30%.

At the global level, the range of uncertainty in electric car sales in 2030 projected 
in automakers’ declarations has grown over the past year, meaning that the 
increase in global sales as envisaged by their targets now ranges from 35-60%. 
However, achieving even the lower end of this range would mean that the number 
of electric car sales in 2030 would be approximately double that of 2024.

Charging electric light-duty vehicles 
Public chargers have doubled since 2022 to reach more 
than 5 million 
Access to public charging points is key to supporting mass adoption 
Home charging remains the most popular way to charge for EV owners. However, 
more public chargers are needed to support mass adoption of EVs among 
segments of the population without access to home chargers.  
In 2024, more than 1.3 million public charging points were added to the global 
stock, representing an increase of more than 30% compared to the previous year. 
Just the charging points added in 2024 were approximately equal to the total 
number of points available in 2020. About two-thirds of the growth in public 
chargers since 2020 has occurred in China, which now has about 65% of the 
charging and 60% of the electric light-duty vehicle stock globally.  
In Europe, the number of public charging points grew more than 35% in 2024 
compared to 2023, to reach just over 1 million. However, there are significant 
variations across countries due to differing rates of EV adoption and charging 
infrastructure development. Within the European Union, 11 out of 27 countries 
saw their public stock of charging points increase by more than 50% in 2024 
compared to the previous year. At the end of 2024, the Netherlands had the 
largest national charging network in Europe, with over 180 000 public charging 
points, followed by Germany (160 000) and France (155 000). In Austria, 8 000 
public charging points were added in 2024, most of which were supported by a 
subsidy that ended at the beginning of 2025.  
Installation of public charging points across the European Union is expected to 
increase as a result of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), 
which mandates the installation of fast-charging stations for cars and vans of at 
least 150 kW every 60 km along the TEN-T core road network by 2025. Each 
station must offer a minimum total power output of 400 kW, increasing to 600 kW 
by the end of 2027. In addition, roll-out of private charging at residential and 
commercial buildings is covered under the revised EU Energy Performance in 
Buildings Directive, which establishes criteria for pre-cabling to prevent the future 
need to retrofit parking infrastructure, which can be costly.

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
The United States increased its charging stock by 20% in 2024 to just under 
200 000 public charging points. The National EV Infrastructure Program, part of 
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was passed in 2021, allocated USD 5 billion 
to fund fast chargers along corridors, although by the end of 2024 only around 
USD 30 million had been spent on charging points that are now in operation. In 
January 2025, Executive Order 14154 paused the disbursement of these funds 
for a review of the processes, policies and programmes associated with grant 
selections, making future disbursements of the remaining unspent funds uncertain.  
Policy efforts in India continue to support charging accessibility, with about 40 000 
new public chargers installed in 2024. In October 2024, INR 20 billion 
(USD 240 million) was allocated to charging infrastructure through the PM E-
DRIVE scheme, with a focus on urban centres and heavily-used transport 
corridors. However, the Indian government has also introduced an EV policy that 
caps the investment in charging infrastructure eligible for tariff relief, potentially 
impacting automakers' plans to invest in EV charging networks.

Brazil's charging infrastructure has expanded at speed. By early December 2024, 
there were over 12 000 public charging points across the country. Public charging 
networks have also experienced rapid expansion in other key emerging markets, 
reflecting strong policy support and investment in infrastructure. Public charging 
points have increased by 60% in Colombia and by 20% in Mexico since 2022.

Similarly, thanks to a mix of government initiatives and private sector collaboration, 
there are now over 24 000 chargers installed across Indonesia, Thailand, 
Malaysia and Viet Nam, 9 times more than in 2022. 
Variation in ratio of EVs per public charger reflects differences 
in market maturity and population demographics 
One way to think about public charging coverage is in terms of the number of 
public charging points compared to the stock of electric light-duty vehicles those 
points are meant to serve. China and the European Union have maintained a 
steady pace of charger deployment compared to the number of EVs on the road, 
though at different levels. There is now more than 1 public charger for every 10 
electric cars in China. On average, the European Union has 1 charger for every 
13 electric cars – a decrease of more than 10% compared to 2023.

However, demand for public charging points also differs based on driver location 
and behaviour. In China’s densely populated cities, many drivers rely on public 
charging points, whereas in Europe, access to home chargers is far higher. The 
combined stock of the top 15 cities by public charger stock in China covers more 
than 50% of the national stock, compared to a share of 25% in Europe. The types 
of housing typically available (apartment, terrace, detached, etc.) can also play an

important role in shaping the need for public charging access. For example, 
Germany and the United Kingdom both have a similar electric car stock share, but 
the United Kingdom has 60% more electric cars per public charger. In Germany, 
more than 60% of people live in apartments or flats; whereas in England and 
Wales, fewer than 25% of people do, meaning it may be easier to install private 
charging. 
In the early stages of electrification, greater availability of public EV charging 
points can encourage adoption. However, as EV adoption increases, and as 
charging speeds become faster and battery ranges improve, the number of 
charger points per vehicle can decrease as the system is optimised.  
Fast charging continues to expand, with ultra-fast charging 
having more than doubled in Europe since 2022  
In addition to coverage, the capacity of public chargers can serve as an indication 
of sufficiency. Fast and ultra-fast public charging points can deliver more energy 
per day than slow chargers and thus serve a higher number of vehicles. In 2024, 
the global stock of fast chargers (with a power output higher than 22 kW and lower 
than 150 kW) reached 2 million, and ultra-fast chargers – capable of delivering 
150 kW or above – growing by over 50% in 2024 and now accounting for nearly 
10% of all fast chargers. Falling costs have played a role in this shift, with the price 
of ultra-fast chargers falling by 20% between 2022 and 2024.  
China remained the largest player in fast charging deployment last year, 
responsible for 80% of the global growth, with the number of fast chargers surging 
from 1.2 million in 2023 to 1.6 million in 2024. Today, the estimated public 
charging capacity per electric LDV in China is over 3 kW. In comparison, the 
United States expanded its total fast charger stock (including ultra-fast) from 
40 000 in 2023 to over 50 000 in 2024, growing at a similar rate to in China. At the 
end of 2024, there was less than 1.5 kW of public charging capacity available in 
the United States per electric LDV.  
Meanwhile, the European Union expanded its network of fast chargers 
(excluding ultra-fast) nearly 50% from 2023 to reach 71 000 in 2024, and has an 
average public charging capacity of 2.6 kW per electric LDV. It also saw strong 
deployment of ultra-fast charging points in 2024, increasing by 60% compared to 
2023 to reach over 77 000 chargers. Denmark saw its stock of ultra-fast chargers 
more than double in 2024, and in France, Finland and Germany the stock 
increased by between 70-95%. Further expansions are also being planned, for 
example in France, where "Charge France", a charge point operator association 
established in 2025, committed to investing EUR 4 billion to expand the national 
stock of ultra-fast charging points from over 17 000 today to 40 000 by 2028.

Of the ultra-fast chargers in the European Union, about 20% deliver a power of 
350 kW and above. Today, only a few high-end electric cars are capable of 
charging at this speed, but charging point operators such as FastNed and 
Iberdrola and BP Pulse are deploying these stations in anticipation of future 
demand. In 2024 this higher segment of ultra-fast chargers almost doubled 
compared to 2023.

Europe, average power per EVSE was used per power group: slow (lower than 22 kW), fast (between 22 kW and 150 kW) 
and ultra-fast (higher than 150 kW) and multiplied with reported stock of chargers. Official national statistics, which rely on 
more granular data, might differ from these values.

Ultra-fast charging infrastructure projects are also underway in Chinese cities. 
Beijing aims to build 1 000 ultra-fast charging stations by the end of 2025, and 
Chongqing to deploy 4 000 additional ultra-fast chargers by the end of 2025.

These regional plans also align with XPeng and Volkswagen’s plans to roll out 
20 000 ultra-fast chargers across more than 400 Chinese cities. 
Elsewhere, Korea has seen rapid growth in its fast charger stock (including ultra-
fast), rising from 34 000 in 2023 to 47 000 in 2024. In 2025, authorities plan to 
deploy 4 400 new fast chargers in high demand areas. Korea’s total budget for 
enhancing charging infrastructure was raised by 40% compared to 2024 to KRW 
620 billion (Korean won) (USD 425 million), with 60% of the assigned budget 
targeting fast chargers, and the remainder dedicated to slow smart-charging 
installations. In India, three major government-owned oil marketing companies 
built nearly 8 000 fast-charging points over the course of 2023 and 2024, funded 
by the FAME Phase II scheme.

Advances in battery technology for electric cars can make charging 
competitive with refuelling time, if charging infrastructure can keep up  
EV owners report that charging speed is their most important consideration when 
using public chargers. Safety concerns relating to EV battery technology have long 
been a limiting factor in reaching faster charging, but recent innovations are now 
reshaping the fast-charging landscape.  
During charging, lithium ions are released from the cathode to the anode. If the 
process is too slow compared to the desired charging speed, lithium can accumulate 
on the anode surface, forming dendrites – needle-like structures that can pierce the 
battery, potentially causing short circuits and uncontrolled fires. Recently, however, 
some battery manufacturers have largely succeeded in addressing this through 
advanced anode designs, such as multi-gradient layered structures, which accelerate 
lithium uptake. 
In 2023, CATL launched the Shenxing battery, which is able to charge about 30% of 
the battery in just 5 minutes, providing 200 km of additional range. This was further 
improved in 2024, when they released a battery offering similar energy density but 
faster charging speeds in collaboration with SAIC-GM – allowing to recharge over 
40% of the battery capacity in 5 minutes – as well as a battery with the same charging 
speed (30% in 5 minutes) but increased energy density, providing 300 km of additional 
range in 5 minutes. For comparison, a typical Tesla supercharger can offer about 
100 km of additional range during the same time.  
In March 2025, BYD set a new benchmark with its Super-e platform, which is claimed 
to deliver around 400 km of range in 5 minutes. This leap was made possible by next-
generation silicon carbide power chips, all-liquid-cooling, and a 1 000 V architecture, 
which allows for coupling with 1 MW charging.  Just one month later, CATL announced 
the second generation of its Shenxing battery, offering even higher charging speeds. 
Megawatt charging was previously limited to heavy-duty vehicles, where the energy 
was distributed across battery packs roughly ten times larger than those in passenger 
cars. Now, advances in battery technology and charging platforms are bringing this 
capability to the passenger car market, with the first models already on sale in China.

Maximum share of battery capacity charged and electric range added in 5 
minutes by electric car model or battery technology 
   
IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Notes: SoC = state of charge. Battery SoC added indicates how much the battery is recharged starting from a low SoC 
(20%). For example, adding 30% SoC means charging the battery from 20% to 50%. The additional range is calculated by 
multiplying the manufacturer’s stated electric range by the proportion of the battery that can be recharged in 5 minutes under 
optimal conditions. Tesla model Y and S are assumed to be charged through a third generation supercharger.  
Sources: IEA analysis based on data from EV Volumes, Tesla, Porsche, Hyundai, Lucid, CATL, GM authority, and BYD. 
 
The full realisation of these advantages, however, hinges on deploying ultra-high-
power charging infrastructure. Megawatt chargers impose significant loads on grids, 
often requiring upgrades that could significantly slow down or limit deployment, and 
are more expensive than fast chargers, which could result in higher charging prices 
for consumers. Pairing these chargers with battery storage to alleviate peak demand 
and optimise grid usage might offer a pathway to accelerate their roll-out. In 
recognition of the infrastructural challenge, BYD – together with its Super-e platform 
– has announced plans to deploy 4 000 megawatt chargers supported by battery 
storage in China. This evolution would also strengthen the interdependencies 
between the two biggest battery markets – EV batteries and battery storage – 
potentially increasing the competitive advantage of producers manufacturing both, 
such as BYD and CATL.  
For most consumers, reliable fast charger networks capable of recharging a vehicle 
in 15-20 minutes may be sufficient for long-distance travel. However, the ability to 
charge EVs in a timeframe comparable to refuelling conventional cars could further 
accelerate consumer adoption.

The location and speed of public charging stations 
reflect typical usage 
Most public chargers are slow chargers in urban areas but 
highway chargers account for a larger share of capacity 
Individual countries and cities have taken different approaches to public charging 
station deployment, based on the distribution of population, availability of home 
charging, and road networks, although there are some commonalities. Currently, 
in Europe and the United States, more than two-thirds of chargers are located in 
urban areas. In the European Union, deployment has broadly followed housing 
patterns, and over 70% of the population now lives within 1 kilometre of a charging 
point. In the United States, which has a lower population density, less than half of 
the population lives within 1 kilometre of a charger.

The public charging infrastructure in cities and urban areas consists mainly of slow 
chargers (less than or equal to 22 kW), which was the most widely adopted 
technology until relatively recently. Only 15% of the urban public chargers in 
Europe are rated over 22 kW. This share is slightly higher in the United States, 
where nearly 30% of urban public chargers are fast. While deploying fast chargers 
can help to serve more EVs per charging point each day, limited available network 
capacity in city centres or urban areas can present a hurdle.

On average, in the United States and Europe, between 4% and 6% of public 
charging points are positioned along highways and have at least 22 kW rate power. 
Norway is an exception, with nearly 20% of its charger stock being fast chargers 
positioned next to highways, as a result of a 2016 target to install fast-charging 
stations at least every 50 km on major roads to support long-distance trips.  When 
considering charging power rather than points, the share becomes even larger, 
with 35% of public charging capacity being located along the highway in Norway. 
Across all countries considered, the share of highway chargers in terms of total 
power is higher than by charging point stock, as highway chargers tend to be the 
fastest.

Major European cities typically have more chargers per EV 
than surrounding areas 
The different characteristics of roads, buildings and parking spaces in different 
cities can affect the strategy for deploying public chargers. In cities such as 
Amsterdam, where residential and office buildings often have less private parking, 
more public chargers need to be available. Public chargers in cities must also 
serve taxis and delivery vehicles, for which overnight charging is not sufficient, as 
well as other visitors to the city that may need to charge during the day. The split 
between overnight charging by residents and opportunity charging for other 
vehicles will affect the speed and distribution of public charges, as reflected by the 
charging capacity per EV in the stock.

European cities have different levels of electric car adoption. Scandinavian cities 
such as Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen have the highest share of electric cars 
in their fleet, with 55%, 35% and 20% of the cars being electric. As the most mature 
market, Oslo also has one of the highest ratios of EVs per charger (over 30) and 
the lowest capacity available per EV (around 1 kW). Both Copenhagen and 
Stockholm have less than 10 EVs per public charging point in the city – lower than 
their national average, which indicates that expanding coverage in cities has been 
prioritised ahead of rural areas around highways.

cities perform better compared to the national and urban averages. In particular, 
the gap between the city capacity per EV and the national average indicate that 
these cities have placed greater emphasis on faster chargers and installing them 
in a higher density compared to other areas outside the city.

European highways have more charger coverage than 
highways in the United States 
At the end of 2024, over 75% of the European highway network had chargers at 
most 50 km apart, whereas only 35% of the US interstate highway system had the 
same level of coverage. Within Europe, coverage is varied: For example, in the 
Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Germany and France, over 90% of the highway 
network has a charging point every 50 km, while in Spain and Poland the share is 
below 80%. Similarly, deployment in the United States varies across regions. In 
the Pacific region (e.g. California, Oregon and Washington), which has the largest 
share of EV stock, 70% of the highways have charging infrastructure every 50 km, 
but in the centre of the country that share is between 20% and 30%.

Notes: TEN-T = Trans-European Transport Network. Chargers between 22 kW and 150 kW are classified as fast, and ultra-

a radius of 150 metres of the highway are included; stations with less than 4 charging points are excluded. Coverage is 
calculated by setting a radius of 25 km around each charging point, so actual driving distance between two charging points 
likely exceeds 50 km based on the curvature of the road and the routing. To determine the number of stations on the 
bottom axis all charging points within 500 metres of each other are considered as one station.

Ultra-fast charging (150 kW and above) allows the most direct comparison with a 
conventional highway pit stop, where charging times of 15 minutes can provide an 
additional 150 km of driving range.1 For long trips on interstate or international 
corridors, EV drivers may prefer a longer break, meaning fast charging at rates 
between 22 kW and 150 kW may also be an attractive option. If fast chargers are 
also taken into account, the charging coverage in the European Union increases, 
with an additional 25% of the roads having a fast charger at least every 50 km. In 
the United States, the share of the interstate road network covered by a charging 
station also increases from nearly 30%, when considering ultra-fast charging 
exclusively, to nearly 40% when also including fast charging.   
Despite the high charging infrastructure coverage along European roads, the 
number of fast-charging stations along highways remains significantly lower than 
that of petrol stations. Ensuring a denser charging network would help to address 
range anxiety and help instil confidence in EV adoption by making charging as 
convenient and reassuring as conventional refuelling. This would allow for more 
flexibility in planning routes around charging stops and help address worst-case 
scenarios, such as unexpected detours, traffic delays, or extreme weather 
conditions.  
Public charging does not always equal accessible charging 
About 20% of public chargers in Europe are in fact “semi-public”, meaning that 
access is limited to part of the population, such as chargers provided by hotels or 
supermarkets that are only accessible to customers. Such chargers may also have 
physical barriers and more limited hours, which degrades charging access and 
experience.  
Technical barriers can also hinder ease of use, even for fully public charging 
stations, as can occur with incompatible plug types (e.g. Type 2, Combined 
Charging System, CHAdeMO). Other factors, such as the payment system or (in 
the case of Tesla chargers), the brand of the vehicle, can also limit the usability of 
charging infrastructure, reducing overall accessibility. Standardisation, in 
combination with access to reliable data on the availability and pricing of charging 
stations, will therefore be important for making public charging infrastructure more 
accessible. 
 
 
1 This estimate assumes a fuel economy of 20 kWh/100 km and a minimum charging level of 20%. For reference, the fuel 
economy of the Tesla Model X is rated at 22.5 kWh/100 km

Light-duty vehicle charging outlook 
Public charging capacity for light-duty EVs grows almost 
ninefold to 2030 
In general, early adopters of electric cars have tended to have higher rates of 
access to home charging than the broader population. Even though electric LDVs 
represent 15% of the global stock in 2030 in the STEPS – which could be 
considered as moving past the early-adopter phase – home charging is expected 
to remain the preferred way to charge an EV when available, given the affordability 
and convenience. Charging availability at other private locations, such as at 
workplaces, and public charging, will also support more widespread adoption of 
EVs, especially among populations without access to home charging, or for 
travelling long distances. In the STEPS, around 150 million charging points are 
added from 2025 to the end of 2030, with almost two-thirds of those being home 
chargers, 30% other private chargers, and the remaining 8% public charging 
points.  
The build-out of public charging points in the STEPS is intended to reflect the 
number required to serve the stock of electric LDVs projected in the scenario. As 
such, the charging projections are based on the policies and market trends driving 
the vehicle projections as opposed to simply matching charging-related policies 
and regulations. The charging point projections do, however, account for regional 
trends, such as the historical evolution of the number of charging points per EV, 
the share and capacity of public fast chargers, and access to home and other 
private charging. Generally, as EV markets mature, optimisation of the public 
charging network is expected to improve, meaning that utilisation can increase 
with no negative effect on user experience. In line with this, in the STEPS, the 
number of electric LDVs per public charging point worldwide increases from about 
11 in 2024 to around 14 in 2030. 
The number of charging points available constitutes just one metric of coverage; 
the installed charging capacity is also important. Public fast chargers, with their 
higher charging capacity, are able to provide more energy and thus serve more 
EVs per day than slow chargers. Over half of the charging capacity installed to 
serve electric LDVs between 2025 and the end of 2030 in the STEPS takes the 
form of fast public chargers. That means that the public fast charging capacity 
increases more than tenfold by 2030, while private charging capacity increases 
less than fourfold.

Global light-duty vehicle charger stock and capacity in the Stated Policies Scenario, 
2024-2030 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Notes: “Private – other” refers to charging points that are neither publicly accessible nor at private residences. Home 
charging stock in 2024 is estimated based on electric light-duty vehicle stock and regional assumptions regarding the ratio 
of home chargers to vehicles. Regional projected electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) stock data can be explored via 
the interactive Global EV Data Explorer. 
 
In China, the relatively low ratio of electric LDVs to public charging points that has 
been maintained over the past decade is partly because Chinese EV owners have 
tended to be concentrated in dense cities with limited access to home charging. 
In the STEPS, the ratio of electric LDVs per public charging point remains 
relatively low but still grows to around 11. The stock of public charging points in 
China grows more than threefold by 2030 in the STEPS, reaching over 12 million 
charging points. The share of public fast chargers continues to grow, as it has 
during the first half of this decade, increasing from around 45% in 2024 to over 
50% in 2030. In 2024, China added about 850 000 public charging points. The 
average annual additions needed to reach the public charging stock projected in 
the STEPS in 2030 are about 75% higher than was observed in 2024, and 60% 
higher than the additions in 2023. For China to reach an electric LDV stock of 
around 140 million in 2030, as in the STEPS, maintaining a ratio of 11 EVs per 
public charging point would require, on average, net additions of 1.5 million 
charging points each year. The public charging capacity in China increases by 
about 900 GW to 2030 in the STEPS. To limit the stress that EV charging puts on 
the grid, the Chinese government has published a policy for standardising vehicle-

Notes: EV = electric vehicle; LDV = light-duty vehicle. Slow refers to charging points with a power rating of 22 kW and 
under, while fast refers to higher power ratings. Regional charging point projections can be explored via the interactive 
Global EV Data Explorer. 
 
In Europe, the stock of public charging points doubles by 2030 in the STEPS to 
reach more than 2 million. The share of fast chargers continues to increase and 
reaches 30% in 2030 in the STEPS, up from less than 20% in 2024. As such, 
public charging capacity across Europe reaches 115 GW in 2030, including slow 
and fast chargers. The increase in the share of fast chargers, as well as the growth 
in their average power rating, means that while the ratio of electric LDVs per 
charging point increases from less than 15 in 2024 to close to 25 in 2030, the 
public charging capacity per vehicle increases to over 2 kW per electric LDV. This 
level of public charging capacity exceeds the power output targets laid out in the 
EU AFIR (1.3 kW per battery electric LDV and 0.8 kW per plug-in hybrid). To reach 
the level of public charging projected in the STEPS in 2030, Europe must add 
210 000 public charging points per year on average through 2030, which is less 
than the 275 000 public charging points added across Europe in 2024.   
Beyond EU regulation, there are national targets for public charging infrastructure 
in Europe. For example, the French government aims to have 400 000 publicly 
accessible charging stations by 2030, about two-and-a-half times the number 
available at the end of 2024. The UK government has stated an aim for at least 
300 000 public charging stations in 2030, about three-and-a-half times the stock 
in 2024. The German government has also previously set a target of 1 million 
public charging points by 2030, though energy industry groups have criticised this 
target for being more than will be needed.

Notes: RoW = Rest of World. In all regions shown, except China, the maximum historical public EV charging point additions 
were observed in 2024; in China the most additions took place in 2023.  
 
In the United States, the stock of public LDV charging points grows from almost 
200 000 at the end of 2024 to over 500 000 at the end of 2030 in the STEPS. This 
assumes the historic trend in the increasing ratio of electric LDV stock per public 
charging point continues, and that in 2030 there are almost 40 electric LDVs per 
public charging point, up from around 32 in 2024. Although this ratio is significantly 
higher than the global average, recent survey findings suggest that over 85% of 
US EV owners have access to home charging. However, with rising EV sales, this 
share is expected to decrease. In addition, the majority of EV owners with home 
chargers still use public chargers weekly. 
The share of fast chargers in the United States grows from less than 30% in 2024 
to 40% in 2030 in the STEPS, meaning that the available public charging capacity 
per electric LDV grows to over 1.5 kW per EV. In 2024, the United States added 
about 35 000 public charging points across the country. To reach the more than 
0.5 million projected in the STEPS in 2030, the United States would need to build 
out an average of 58 000 public charging points per year. At the end of 2024, fewer 
than 200 stations funded through the NEVI programme were in operation 
(representing less than 1% of the 2024 public charging additions), but over 3 500 
had conditional awards or agreements in place. However, as the policies 
underlying the implementation of the NEVI Formula Program are now under 
review, the future of federal funding for EV charging infrastructure is uncertain. 
Nevertheless, NEVI and other federally funded charging points have previously 
been estimated to represent less than 15% of announced non-home charging 
deployments.

In India, the number of public charging points increases from 75 000 at the end of 
2024 to around 375 000 by the end of 2030 in the STEPS to support a stock of 
less than 3 million electric LDVs. As a result, in 2030 in the STEPS there are 
around 7 electric LDVs per public charging point, up from fewer than 4 in 2024. To 
reach this projected stock of public charging points, around 50 000 charging points 
would need to be added on average each year through 2030, about 30% more 
than the number of additions observed in 2024. India’s PM E-DRIVE Scheme 
includes INR 20 billion (Indian rupees) (USD 240 million) for public EV charging 
stations, with plans to support a targeted 22 100 EV chargers for electric four-
wheeled vehicles through March 2026.  
Across other countries, about 630 000 public charging points are added between 
the end of 2024 and 2030 in the STEPS, or an average of 105 000 new public 
charging points per year. Governments around the world have set targets for 
public charging points to support expansion to 2030 and beyond. Japan targets a 
stock of 300 000 public charging points by 2030, about 9 times the stock at the 
end of 2024. The government of New Zealand aims to have 10 000 charge points 
by 2030, a seven-fold increase from the end of 2024. Across Southeast Asia, 
Indonesia aims to reach 30 000 charging stations by 2030 and Thailand 12 000. 
Charging electric heavy-duty vehicles 
Megawatt-scale chargers are now being deployed 
In general, electric heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) can use the same charging 
equipment as LDVs, although different charging station configurations may be 
needed to accommodate the HDVs, given their larger size. In addition, as the 
batteries of HDVs are larger and therefore take longer to replenish, higher-
powered chargers are needed to minimise disruptions to regular operations. The 
effective deployment of electric HDVs is therefore likely to require the buildout of 
devoted charging equipment to ensure charging times compatible with the 
operational efficiency of commercial fleets. Most electric HDV operators today rely 
on depot charging when the vehicles are not in use, typically overnight, but en 
route or opportunity chargers are generally also needed to enable longer-range 
applications. 
The growth in deployment of electric buses has been enabled by the buildout of 
charging depots by national and local governments as well as by transit agencies. 
For example, in the United Kingdom, the government’s Zero Emission Bus 
Regional Areas scheme supported the establishment of an electric bus charging 
hub to power South Yorkshire’s first electric buses. Germany’s Deutsche Bahn 
and various partners have supported charging infrastructure for electric buses that 
charge exclusively at the depot overnight. In China, policy support for bus charging 


Global EV Outlook 2025 
Electric vehicle charging

IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
infrastructure has helped to enable huge growth in the electric bus stock, with 
megawatt-scale charging being demonstrated for buses in Sichuan at the end of 
2024.  
As with buses, the roll-out of depot chargers is expected to lead the first phase of 
electric truck charging deployment, as fleet operators have the greatest control 
over private charging infrastructure. However, scaling up public chargers of 
350 kW or more will be critical to support wider adoption. The EU Alternative Fuels 
Infrastructure Regulation sets specific targets for HDV charging, including 
charging points with an individual power output of at least 350 kW every 60 km 
along primary roads and every 100 km along secondary roads. Megawatt 
chargers are also expected to play a role in HDV charging, given that reducing 
charging time is highly valued in the sector. An HDV with a battery pack of 
300 kWh (similar to the global sales-weighted average in 2024) would require 
about 30 minutes to recharge2 using a 350 kW charger, but only about 15 minutes 
using a megawatt charger.  
In 2024, the world’s first megawatt chargers for trucks were deployed in the 
United States and Europe, marking a key technological milestone. Enabling such 
higher-powered charging requires timely planning, permitting and investment to 
upgrade power grids. Both depot and public charging frequently require grid 
reinforcements to enable ultra-fast charging, sometimes in remote locations. Even 
if overnight charging in depots or service stations is relatively slow, the grid 
connection must be able to handle the parallel charging of multiple vehicles. 
Coupling megawatt chargers with battery storage can alleviate grid stress, 
reducing the need for power grid upgrades and accelerating megawatt charger 
deployments. This approach could be important for speeding up the roll-out of 
electric trucks, and has also been announced for ultra-fast charging of cars (see 
the Box above). 
National statistics on HDV-specific chargers are not readily available for most 
countries. However, there is evidence that in China, one company alone had built 
about 1 350 charging stations with over 5 500 charging points for electric trucks 
by the end of October 2024, each with a charging capacity of more than 320 kW. 
Based on data compiled by Atlas EV Hub, the United States reported around 500 
operational HDV charging points in October 2024 – about double the number at 
the beginning of 2024 – and over 1 000 more are planned. Less than one-third of 
the existing chargers are accessible to the public, but around 85% of all planned 
chargers, including at high-power charging stations, are expected to be publicly 
accessible.  
 
 
2 Between 20% and 80% of the battery state of charge.

The expansion of HDV charging infrastructure extends beyond these major EV 
markets. In India, the PM E-DRIVE scheme proposes installing 1 800 fast 
chargers for e-buses in larger cities and on selected highways. Elsewhere, Qatar’s 
Public Bus Infrastructure Program has built over 650 charging points for electric 
buses to support the country’s goal of reaching 100% public bus electrification by 
2030. In Latin America, countries are collaborating to build EV recharging 
corridors, including for buses and trucks, and the first truck charging station in 
Peru was opened at the Port of Callao in 2024. In Singapore, Volt has been 
awarded a contract to develop and operate an 80-point direct-current charging 
hub for electric taxis, buses and other EVs. Meanwhile, Malaysian government-
owned Prasarana has issued tenders for electric bus procurement and charging 
infrastructure deployment. 
Industry players are teaming up to deploy charging for 
heavy trucks 
HDV charging infrastructure is still in its early stages and requires significant 
investments, but it is gaining momentum. Private companies are joining forces to 
expand charging networks. In the United States, Greenlane – a joint venture 
between Daimler Truck North America, NextEra Energy and BlackRock – 
announced plans for a commercial EV charging corridor from Los Angeles to Las 
Vegas, with over 100 chargers. Meanwhile, DTNA, Navistar and Volvo teamed up 
to establish the Powering America’s Commercial Transportation coalition to 
accelerate deployment of chargers for medium- and heavy-duty trucks.  
In Europe in 2024, Milence, a joint venture between Daimler Truck, TRATON and 
Volvo, presented its plans to establish a European charging network of 70 hubs, 
accounting for more than 570 high-power (some > 1 MW) charging points by the 
end of 2025. The company has previously announced the goal to reach 1 700 
charging points across Europe by 2027. In addition, E.ON and MAN Truck & Bus 
are collaborating to set up around 400 electric truck charging stations in 170 
different locations in Europe, as part of a project that has received EUR 45 million 
in EU funding. The BP subsidiary Pulse, which today owns the majority of truck 
charging stations in Germany, also announced its co-operation with the Polish 
charging infrastructure manufacturer Ekoenergetyka, although the terms of the 
collaboration have not yet been disclosed. Various project partners are 
collaborating under the CLOSER platform to support electrified logistics, including 
to develop a Scandinavian charging network for electric trucks.  
International programmes and initiatives can also support the advancement of 
HDV charging. Zero-Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Support and Expansion 
(ZEVWISE) leads the Global Green Road Corridors Initiative, aiming to develop 
at least ten green road corridors worldwide by 2026, with the latest two new

corridors announced at COP29. These corridors aim to deploy sufficient charging 
infrastructures along key routes connecting industrial hubs, ports and cities, and 
focus on creating replicable models for infrastructure deployment and financing, 
aiming to accelerate global deployment. The Kuehne Climate Center and Smart 
Freight Centre have also initiated the Green Freight Support Program in Eastern 
Africa. 
Heavy-duty vehicle charging outlook 
Charging capacity for trucks and buses increases more 
than fivefold by 2030 
Just as for charging LDVs, overnight charging tends to be the most attractive 
option for buses and trucks, as it requires lower power and is typically cheaper. 
This is especially the case among early adopters. While public or opportunity 
charging infrastructure for electric HDVs is limited, electric fleet owners and/or 
operators typically choose to install depot chargers at close to a one-to-one ratio 
to allow the fleet to charge concurrently during the night. Of course, to enable 
longer daily driving ranges, en route or other opportunity chargers (such as at 
terminal bus stops or highway service stations) are needed to expand the 
applications that can be met by electric HDVs.

points remain located at depots through this decade in this scenario. The stock of 
chargers for trucks grows more quickly than for buses, increasing from a third of 
all HDV chargers to almost 60% in 2030 in the STEPS.  
The charging capacity for electric HDVs grows similarly to the stock – increasing 
about five times to 2030 in the STEPS to reach more than 500 GW. Given that the 
role for higher-power opportunity chargers is expected to remain limited this 
decade, the overall charging capacity for HDVs remains around 100 kW per 
electric HDV.  
Despite the relatively low power rating for depot chargers – typically 50-150 kW 
compared to 350 kW to 1 MW+ for some opportunity charging – grid upgrades at 
depots may be needed, especially for larger fleets. Grid upgrades can take from 
one to several years, depending (in particular) on the voltage. Anticipatory 
planning is needed to ensure adequate availability of HDV chargers in the 
medium- to long-term. 
Daytime charging of HDVs may also be suited to renewables, such as solar PV, 
which would support integration and ease grid demand. Co-locating HDV charging 
stations with battery storage can also be a way to ease grid infrastructure 
requirements and accelerate the deployment of HDV charging, especially in the 
context of record-low battery prices. Battery-swapping and electric road systems 
are other options being explored that could reduce impacts on the grid. 
Government policies and support will be needed to ensure a smooth roll-out of 
charging for HDVs. The EU AFIR includes increasing coverage requirements for 
HDV charging points with a power output of at least 350 kW along the TEN-T 
Network starting in 2025. According to the Action Plan for the EU automotive 
sector, the European Commission will make another EUR 570 million available 
under the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Facility towards the roll-out of alternative 
fuels infrastructure in 2025 and 2026, with a particular focus on HDVs.  
Smart charging and vehicle-grid integration  
Smart charging gains popularity, bolstered by smart 
charging roll-out mandates 
Electric vehicles represent less than 1% of global electricity demand today, but 
their contribution to power demand is affected by charging behaviour. Depending 
on local grid conditions, EV charging can put stress on electricity grids. Extra 
demand from unmanaged EV charging during peak times can mean grids need to 
enlist more carbon-intensive power plants and may increase electricity prices for 
households using electricity at these times. As a result, governments, utilities and 
private companies have started to develop and deploy technologies to enable 


Global EV Outlook 2025 
Electric vehicle charging

smart charging. Smart chargers can be connected to the internet and accessed 
remotely, allowing for controlled scheduling. When used in conjunction with 
differentiated tariffs, smart chargers enable EV owners to charge flexibly and take 
advantage of the cheapest tariffs under different pricing regimes (e.g. time-of-use, 
dynamic real-time, critical peak pricing, etc.), while providing demand-side 
flexibility for grid operators. Smart charging can also support EV battery health, 
such as by adjusting the maximum charging rate to avoid overcharging and 
excessive heat, which can degrade batteries over time. 
Smart charging is advancing towards wider commercial deployment. The 
United Kingdom was among the first countries to mandate that all new home 
charge points for EVs must have smart functionality from 2022. Prior to this, only 
52% of UK EV owners with home charging capabilities had a smart charger. The 
EU AFIR specifies that all chargers that are installed or renovated from April 2024 
must support smart charging. China has longstanding policies on smart charging 
roll-out from previous Five-Year Plans on Electric Vehicle Deployment, with newer 
chargers now having smart charging capabilities. Elsewhere, Brazil is taking 
strides in expanding EV infrastructure through its “electrocenters” – charging hubs 
designed to optimise power distribution to ensure grid resilience while 
accommodating multiple vehicles simultaneously, launched in March 2024.   
Multiple actors are involved in efforts to implement 
vehicle-to-grid solutions 
While smart charging enables EV owners to choose when to charge their EVs, bi-
directional charging provides them with the opportunity to discharge power from 
their EVs to their homes (vehicle-to-home, or V2H), buildings (V2B), or other 
appliance loads (V2L) and the grid (V2G). Bi-directional charging can be used to 
recharge car batteries when electricity is cheapest, and then sell electricity back 
to the grid (V2G) when prices are higher. It can also be used to discharge car 
batteries to provide emergency or off-grid power supply to buildings or loads (V2B, 
V2H, V2L).   
For widespread application of V2G, multiple legal and technological hurdles need 
to be overcome so that demand-side flexibility from EVs can work effectively for 
the maximum benefit of EV owners and grid operators. Progress across markets 
is currently mixed due to the complexity of the requirements needed along the 
V2G pipeline.  
As a first step, smart chargers that can schedule charging and discharging from 
the grid must be deployed across the EV charging network. Secondly, EVs must 
be capable of bi-directional charging. Today there are over 30 bi-directional-
capable models available, an increase of nearly 20% from 2023. Bi-directional 
models now make up more than one in eight new electric cars sold, with models 


Global EV Outlook 2025

such as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and 6; BYD Dolphin and Yuan Plus; MG 4/Mulan and 
Kia EV6 among the most popular. In addition, OEMs have begun to work together 
to address common challenges associated with V2G integration, such as through 
ChargeScape, which brings together Nissan, BMW, Ford and Honda. 
Different market structures will also be needed to support the application of V2G 
technologies. For example, differentiated tariffs provide financial incentives for EV 
owners to optimise their charging. Aggregators and ancillary service markets act 
as middle management between grid distribution operators, to provide bids and 
pool flexible EVs and other storage devices so that grid operators can then 
purchase this flexibility. To facilitate the transmission of electricity between these 
market aggregators, sufficient management of EV batteries connecting to the grid 
must also be supported by adequate grid infrastructure so as to avoid grid 
congestion and enable bi-directional charging.  
Demonstration trials of V2G projects are currently underway in markets including 
Australia, China, Germany, Korea and the United Kingdom, where the 
government is funding 20 V2G projects involving around 600 cars. A 
demonstration project launched in November 2024 in the Netherlands represents 
one of the largest V2G car-sharing services in Europe to date, using 500 Renault 
5 E-Tech BEVs. In 2023, the Korea Electric Power Corporation was involved in a 
100-vehicle V2G pilot programme. It found that EVs effectively contributed to peak 
shaving, and that battery degradation was minimal, but further refinement of 
financial incentives would be needed to make the V2G system financially attractive 
to a wide consumer base. In August 2024, China’s National Development and 
Reform Commission issued a notice promoting the piloting of large-scale 
applications of V2G interactions, and selected 5 cities to kick off at least 50 V2G 
pilot projects. The notice also established grid communication standards for EV 
charging equipment that enables V2G bi-directional charging. A national road map 
for bi-directional charging has been developed by Australia, which suggests that 
adopting V2G in just 10% of Australia’s projected EVs could help meet more than 
one-third of the national electricity market’s storage needs in 2030. As of February 
2025, a small number of Australian households have adopted V2G technology 
and are selling power back to the grid. In the United States, in March 2025, 
ComEd, an energy provider in northern Illinois, partnered with Nuvve to launch a 
V2G pilot programme focusing on electric school buses. 
Policy measures targeting bi-directional charging are increasingly being 
introduced in different markets worldwide. In the European Union, updated AFIR 
requirements will include standards that enable bi-directional charging, starting in 
2027. In the United States, the Federal Highway Administration previously 
mandated via the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (2021) that chargers 
must conform to and possess hardware capable of implementing both smart

charging and bi-directional charging for compatible vehicles (ISO 15118-20). At 
the state level, California enacted legislation to promote V2G adoption in 
September 2024.  
Ensuring compatibility and interoperability of the chargers and EVs involved are 
the final challenges. The CHAdeMO EV charging system first introduced V2G 
communication in 2010 and has been the first mover in this domain. Since then, 
the charging protocols adopted by the CHAdeMo Association have continued to 
evolve as technology has developed. Several organisations have also been 
working to define appropriate standards and use cases. Efforts to standardise 
protocols and grid codes are ongoing through the Electric Vehicle Technology 
Collaboration Programme Task 53: Interoperability of Bidirectional Charging. In 
addition, the International Electrotechnical Commission has published use cases 
on how EVs might provide distributed energy resource functionality.

Shaping human behaviour around charging will be key to unlocking the full 
benefits of electric vehicles 
Patterns of human behaviour will have a big impact on how EVs affect the grid. Different 
charging habits will affect the costs of charging, grid congestion and reliability, but with 
the right incentives to align charging behaviour with the needs of the grid, EVs could 
become a major source of flexibility and demand response.   
Charging behaviour also affects emissions. Many electric grids – such as those in 
California, Germany, and Spain – have deployed large amounts of solar power, which 
peaks around midday. If EV charging uses this solar power, while avoiding peak load 
periods such as early evening when people return home after work, EVs could help 
stabilise the grid while also maximising emissions reductions. In California, electric cars 
charged overnight emit 76% less CO2 than conventional ICE vehicles – but EVs charged 
around midday go much further, slashing emissions 95% relative to ICEs.

Social science research is now looking at how to influence behaviour in ways that help 
EVs become a reliable resource for the grid and cut emissions. Researchers from the 
University of California San Diego (UC San Diego), working with the Electric Power 
Research Institute and others, are using randomised controlled trials at UC San Diego’s 
network of over 500 charging points. Experiments that derived from 1 200 drivers are 
assessing whether interventions change habits in the real world. 
In one study, they told drivers how midday charging reduces emissions and found that 
drivers responded by reducing their campus charging at times other than midday by 5%. 
While modest, this effect is similar in scale to other kinds of informational “nudges” studied 
with other behaviours that affect the grid, such as household energy choices. A key issue 
the research team explored is that many EV drivers have little prior knowledge about 
charging costs and emissions impacts. Information helps fill that void.  
A second project offered discounts for campus charging to test drivers’ willingness to 
relocate their charging. In a twist, incentives to charge on campus actually led drivers to 
Gasoline ICEV (baseline):
5.1 t CO2
BEV charged overnight:
1.2 t CO2 (-76%)
BEV charged midday:
0.3 t CO2 (-95%)

charge more (7%) in the early morning and overnight, rather than during the midday solar 
peak. The findings suggest that scarcity of chargers was the reason for this unexpected 
behaviour – drivers expected that the discounts would increase competition for scarce 
chargers and tended to hoard access as a result.  
Some recent preliminary findings suggest that network quality also affects charging 
behaviour. When drivers have poor charging experiences, they are reluctant to return. 
This points to the increasing need to focus on the quality of charging networks, not just 
the quantity of charge points. Some policy makers have begun this shift, such as in 
Germany.  
As the number of EVs on the road increases, choices about charging will have bigger 
impacts on the grid. That raises the stakes for learning how to get people to charge in 
more optimal ways, which will often mean at offices and other locations away from home 
at differing times of the day. Using real-world charging data to test business models will 
be vital for sustainably building the networks to support such charging.  
Transport flexibility through methods such as smart and managed charging has relevance 
around the world. For example, in a case where EVs represent 80% of the vehicle stock 
in Europe, and over 40% of final energy demand is met by electricity, around a quarter of 
this electricity demand has some flexibility potential. Over a third of this flexibility potential 
comes from EVs, where optimised smart charging and changes in charging behaviour 
can shift peak demand away from the congestion and higher emissions that occur during 
evening hours to the middle of the day when the availability of renewables, especially 
solar, to supply the grid would be higher than the electricity demand without the additional 
charging load.

electric vehicle stock share.

Innovative charging solutions 
While cabled charging is expected to remain the predominant technology for 
charging EVs into the foreseeable future, alternative solutions are also making 
headway. Battery swapping systems, for example, have been around in some 
form for over a century, though use has been somewhat limited, but deployment 
is now rapidly growing in certain regions and segments. Battery swapping is 
proving especially successful in commercial applications such as delivery or ride-
hailing services, where downtime for charging can be costly. 
Battery swapping can offer benefits by reducing the upfront cost of EVs; improving 
battery longevity, especially with professional handling of swaps; alleviating stress 
on power grids; and facilitating reuse and recycling efforts when batteries remain 
under the ownership of the swap company. However, these systems may increase 
overall demand for batteries and would benefit from design standardisation that 
could be difficult to achieve at large scales in some markets. Standardising 
batteries could also inhibit innovation, such as the development of cell-to-chassis 
architectures that can improve EV efficiency by reducing the weight of battery 
systems. The benefits of standardisation for battery swapping must be weighed 
against the risk of constraining market competition and innovation.  
Dynamic charging – which takes place while vehicles are moving – is also being 
explored. This can be accomplished through conductive charging, such as using 
overhead catenary lines, which are already commonly used to power transport 
systems like trams and light rail systems, or through inductive, wireless charging, 
which is at an earlier stage of development and deployment. Both systems can be 
deployed at strategic locations for stationary charging, such as at bus stops or 
logistics centres where vehicles already spend time idle.  
These systems and other innovations, such as solar-coupled charging systems, 
can play a role in making charging more convenient and/or a source of flexible 
demand for renewables, as well as reducing charging-related stress on grids. 
Battery swapping for 2/3Ws is increasingly popular in 
emerging markets 
Battery swapping systems for 2/3Ws offer a number of benefits, including 
improving affordability, which can be particularly helpful for consumers in 
developing economies, where upfront costs can be a barrier. The “battery-as-a-
service” subscription model can lower the upfront investment required for an 
electric 2W, as the battery typically accounts for around 40% of the total price. In 
terms of operational costs, for the amount of range provided, battery-swap-
enabled 2/3Ws are around 20-50% cheaper than petrol 2/3Ws, and the economic 
case improves as daily driving distance increases. Battery swapping can also offer 


Global EV Outlook 2025 
Electric vehicle charging 
PAGE | 128  
time savings. While at least 20 minutes (and typically several hours) is required 
for recharging an electric 2W, battery swapping can be performed in just 2-5 
minutes – approximately the same amount of time needed to refuel a gasoline 
motorcycle. It can eliminate the need for home charging, making electric 2/3Ws 
more accessible to drivers with limited electricity access. In addition, in countries 
with underdeveloped power grids, the more centralised load/demand 
management offered by some battery swap stations can be beneficial.  
Thailand, for example, is targeting 1 450 battery swapping stations by 2030. In 
Indonesia, the start-up SWAP Energi currently operates around 1 500 electric 2W 
battery swap stations in the country. The Indonesian government has set the 
target of about 67 000 battery swap stations, for either motorcycles or cars, by 
2030. 
Battery swapping has also taken off in India in the past 5 years, thanks to 
technological improvements for batteries and falling costs coinciding with a rise in 
gasoline prices. Electric 2/3Ws – sold without the battery – have now become 
accessible even to low-income buyers. Battery Smart is India’s largest battery 
swap operator for 2/3Ws and reached 1 000 stations in April 2024. Indian 
company Sun Mobility is also growing fast, with more than 630 swapping stations 
in 19 Indian cities. There are also plans to deploy 10 000 Piaggio electric 3Ws with 
swappable batteries in the country, alongside 300 new swapping stations. 
In Chinese Taipei, the market for electric 2/3Ws has grown significantly due to 
strong demand and government support, accompanied by an innovative, 
widespread battery swapping mechanism that has become a global leader. 
Domestic battery swapping pioneer Gogoro now has around 13 000 battery swap 
stations worldwide, each roughly the size of 2 vending machines and able to hold 
around 30 scooter batteries. In the city of Taipei, there are now more Gogoro 
battery swapping stations for 2Ws than gas stations. A total 2 500 Gogoro stations 
use artificial intelligence (AI) and can act as a virtual power plant – drawing power 
from the grid when usage is low, and returning it when usage is high, and even 
supplying back-up power in emergencies. After the country was hit by an 
earthquake in April 2024, battery swap stations made 6 MW of power available, 
enough to power thousands of homes. However, Gogoro has struggled to find a 
sustainable business model and benefits from government purchase subsidies.  
In Africa, Spiro, an electric motorbike manufacturer and battery swapping provider, 
has put over 22 000 e-bikes on the road across a number of different countries. 
Kenyan company Arc Ride runs a battery-as-a-service model for 2W battery 
swapping, with over 140 stations, mostly around Nairobi. Kenya is also a target 
for Rwandan Ampersand’s expansion plans, and Roam is setting up solar-
powered fast battery charging and swapping for electric motor cycles in the 
country.  


Global EV Outlook 2025

Battery swapping systems for 2/3Ws are still in their infancy in Europe, a far 
smaller market for 2/3Ws, although the supermarket chain Kaufland is operating 
swapping stations for batteries for small electric cars or electric 2Ws in Romania 
in co-operation with the e-Mobility Rentals start-up. Honda is also launching 
battery swap stations in Sweden for their electric scooters. 
Greater standardisation and interoperability would be needed to fully reap the 
benefits of battery swapping and reduce the need for costly charging 
infrastructure. This would also enable the aggregation of demand for electric 2/3W 
batteries and help to guide industry development. In 2022, various Japanese 
OEMs established a new company, Gachaco, to offer a battery sharing and 
swapping services for standardised, exchangeable 2W batteries. More recently, 
in 2024, Thailand launched the Thailand Standard Swappable Battery Consortium 
for Small e-Mobility to work towards elevating the national standard to the level of 
international standards.  
Battery swapping for cars is growing in China and 
entering new markets 
Chinese EV manufacturer NIO built its first battery swap station for electric cars in 
2018 and has remained the market leader ever since. By the end of 2024, NIO 
had built over 3 000 battery swap stations in China and 50 in Europe. In just 2 
years, the company more than doubled its battery swap stations in China. In an 
effort to co-ordinate battery standards and battery swapping technologies, and 
maximise the utilisation of NIO’s network, the company has agreements with 
Geely Group, JAC Group and Chery Automobile, which together represented 15% 
of electric car sales in China in 2024. 
Battery maker CATL introduced its battery swap solution, EVOGO, in 2022. The 
company has since announced the ambition to reach 3 000 stations by 2027, and 
eventually 10 000 stations. In 2024, CATL and ride-hailing company DiDi formed 
a joint venture to build out battery swap stations and swappable vehicles, and at 
the end of the year, CATL launched a Battery Swap Ecosystem with nearly 100 
partners to move towards the standardisation of EV battery swapping. The 
programme also aims to build 30 000 battery swap stations that will also work as 
battery-to-grid energy storage facilities. 
In 2024, Ample announced it was partnering with ENEOS to bring battery swap 
stations to Kyoto, in a first for Japan. Ample is also partnering with Stellantis, 
beginning with a programme to provide battery swap stations in Madrid for Fiat 
500e cars in the Free2Move car-sharing service.

For trucks, battery swapping can offer savings in terms 
of reducing charging time 
As of June 2023, there were around 400 battery swap stations for trucks in China. 
While battery swapping for heavy-duty trucks is still at an early stage of 
deployment, it has the potential to support faster uptake of electric trucks by 
extending battery lifespan and reducing the wait time for charging, thus enhancing 
efficiency for commercial operations. For example, even electric truck batteries 
large enough to enable daily mileage suitable for long-distance transportation can 
be exchanged in around 10 minutes – almost as fast as refuelling a diesel truck. 
Battery swapping for trucks can offer greater benefit in terms of preserving battery 
health compared to other EV segments; the constant use and long distances 
travelled by trucks result in increased battery degradation, which is compounded 
by reliance on fast-charging solutions that further accelerate degradation. 
Battery swapping is particularly well-suited to fleets of identical trucks with heavy 
operational demands, operating on well-defined routes. These fleets could justify 
the significant investment required in automated swapping facilities and additional 
batteries. As such, battery swapping has been deployed for trucks used in short-
haul applications at ports, mining sites, urban and even regional logistics, 
particularly in China where sales of swap-capable electric trucks reached almost 
30 000 last year. Elsewhere, Rio Tinto announced in 2024 they would trial eight 
electric dump trucks with battery swap technology for their mining operations in 
Mongolia. In Japan, field tests using courier services also began in 2024 for a 
Mitsubishi Fuso and Ample truck battery swap demonstration.  
Technological advances have enhanced the safety, reliability and convenience of 
battery swapping systems for trucks in recent years. Intelligent systems can now 
automatically assess battery status and perform the swapping service. In China, 
new policies were announced in 2024, enacting safety standards for swap-
capable HDVs and establishing technical specification systems. However, in other 
parts of the world, the required level of standardisation may make it difficult for 
battery swapping to compete with conventional plug-in charging, especially for 
certain heavy-duty truck segments. 
In Europe, the region’s first fully automated heavy-duty electric truck battery 
swapping station opened in Germany in 2023. Swappable batteries are also being 
used as hybrid solutions for trucks, for example in German company Trailer 
Dynamics’ electric trailer with a swappable battery. Similarly, in the United States, 
Revoy has launched a battery swapping solution that can integrate with semi-
trucks, offering up to 235 miles of range, which can essentially turn a diesel truck 
into a hybrid vehicle, or serve as a range extender for an electric truck. While

battery swapping demonstrations and technology developments are ongoing, 
outside of China, manufacturers have been reluctant to separate battery 
ownership from vehicles, which would disrupt traditional revenue streams, and to 
standardise, which has been crucial to China's success. 
Electric road systems are being tested across major EV 
markets 
Electric road systems (ERS) enable vehicles to receive electricity while moving 
using one of three main technologies: conductive overhead (catenary) lines, 
conductive contact rails beneath the vehicles, and inductive wireless systems 
embedded in the road. Conductive contact rails and inductive systems can charge 
both light and heavy vehicles, while overhead lines are used for heavy vehicles. 
In all cases, vehicles must be equipped with appropriate pantographs or receivers. 
ERS allow for smaller batteries and could therefore be a cost-effective solution for 
electrifying the road sector, especially for heavy-duty trucks that follow well-
defined routes, while ERS-enabled smaller batteries can increase a commercial 
vehicle’s payload and profitability. Research has highlighted the benefits of 
wireless charging of buses to resolve space constraints at depots and to enable 
en route charging that can make battery electric buses more comparable to 
gasoline fuelled buses in terms of operations. Similar benefits exist for catenary 
charging solutions strategically located at bus stops. However, ERS infrastructure 
is expensive to install – depending on the type of system, the cost per kilometre 
could range from EUR 1.5 million for overhead catenary to over EUR 3 million for 
inductive charging. 
Test projects for electric road technology are ongoing worldwide, exploring both 
inductive and conductive methods. Sweden has been a global pioneer, while 
projects are also being undertaken in the United States, China and Japan. The 
United States primarily focuses on inductive technology, while Germany and 
France, historically focused on conductive technology, are now also testing 
inductive systems. Some of the earliest test projects in Europe, particularly in 
Sweden, have now been retired.

Wide application of ERS faces many hurdles – besides the large investments required for 
infrastructure development, vehicles must be adapted to the specific charging technology. 
Governance can also be difficult, as ERS requires a market design appropriate for both the 
transport and energy market, which have distinct regulatory regimes. The costs of ERS 
must also be evaluated in the context of alternative charging systems: A 2024 report 
commissioned by the Swedish government (which had previously announced ambitions to 
build 3 000 km of electric roads by 2035) recommended against further expansion of ERS 
in Sweden, in part as the development of batteries for EVs has progressed rapidly. Plans 
to build the world's first permanent electrified road, which would have connected 
Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo, were paused in 2023.

Trends in battery demand 
Global battery demand for the energy sector hit the 
1 TWh milestone in 2024 
Electric cars remain the main driver of battery demand, but 
demand for trucks nearly doubled 
Battery demand in the energy sector, for both EV batteries and storage 
applications, reached the historical milestone of 1 TWh in 2024. Demand for one 
average week alone in 2024 exceeded the total demand for an entire year just a 
decade earlier. Demand was largely driven by growth in EV sales, as demand for 
EV batteries grew to over 950 GWh – 25% more than in 2023. Electric cars remain 
the principal factor behind EV battery demand, accounting for over 85%. 
Compared to 2023, the sector whose demand grew the most was electric trucks, 
growing over 75% in 2024 to reach nearly 3% of global EV battery demand. 
Electric truck battery demand was driven by growth in China, but demand also 
ramped up in Europe (about 25%), which accounted for about 10% of the global 
total.

In 2024, EV battery demand grew by over 30% in China, and by 20% in the 
United States, in stark contrast with the European Union, where demand stalled. 
Battery demand in the United States nearly matched that of the European Union 
in 2024, in part as a result of its approximately 25% larger battery size per EV. 
Emerging markets and developing economies other than China continued to 
represent only a small share of global battery demand, reaching nearly 5% in 
2024. Nevertheless, their share has doubled since 2022, underpinned by 
sustained growth in Southeast Asia, India and Brazil.

Outlook for battery demand 
Electric vehicle battery demand jumps more than 
threefold by 2030  
EV battery demand continues to grow, and is expected to reach more than 3 TWh 
in 2030 in the STEPS, up from about 1 TWh in 2024. While electric cars will remain 
the primary driver of battery demand, other modes are set to gain market share. 
Notably, the contribution of electric trucks to EV battery demand triples by 2030 to 
reach more than 8%, up from nearly 3% in 2024.

and not the battery demand for vehicles manufactured in each region. Electric vehicle and battery stockpiling are excluded 
from the analysis. 
 
Battery demand is also set to become more geographically diverse. In the STEPS, 
emerging markets and developing economies other than China are expected to 
double their share of EV battery demand, from nearly 5% in 2024 to 10% in 2030. 
The share of global demand in the European Union and other advanced 
economies, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Korea, is also 
projected to grow, while the share of the United States is projected to decline from 
about 13% in 2024 to less than 10% by 2030. Meanwhile, China’s share of global 
battery demand declines from 60% in 2024 to just under 50% by 2030, although it 
remains by far the single largest source of demand. 
Battery industry trends 
Chinese manufacturers are increasing their competitive 
advantage 
Low critical mineral prices and intense competition drove down 
battery prices in 2024, but China’s price advantage is widening 
Prices for lithium-ion battery packs fell 20% in 2024 – the largest drop since 2017 
– as a result of low critical mineral prices and battery margins being squeezed 
through competition, predominantly in China. Lithium prices, in particular, dropped

nearly 20% in 2024, reaching similar prices to those at the end of 2015, despite 
lithium demand in 2024 being about six times bigger than in 2015.  
Low critical mineral prices are primarily driven by supply surplus, which is making 
it difficult for some mining companies to compete, thus increasing the level of 
supply chain concentration among established players. This surplus is expected 
to persist over the next few years, but low prices could discourage future 
investments and might cause supply shortages for lithium and nickel by 2030. In 
addition, the high geographical and ownership concentration of their supply chains 
may cause market distortions, increasing market risk.  
An undersupply of lithium would push up prices, to the benefit of the mining sector 
but to the detriment of battery and EV makers, as well as final consumers. The 
recycling sector, which could help curb cost increases, would also benefit from 
higher mineral prices. However, due to feedstock limitations, it will take about a 
decade before recycling has a significant impact on reducing primary mineral 
demand (see the Box on battery recycling below).  
Technology innovation, particularly related to sodium-ion batteries or direct lithium 
extraction, could be instrumental in reducing the risk of lithium undersupply and 
its potential impact, and avoiding price spikes similar to those seen in 2022. 
Additionally, vertical integration through upstream investments can help battery 
suppliers to lower production costs while safeguarding against the risk of volatile 
critical mineral prices.

Battery pack prices fell in all markets, but the extent of the drop varied significantly, 
with the fastest declines seen in China, where prices fell nearly 30% in 2024, 
compared to 10-15% in Europe and the United States. This widened the gap 
between battery prices in China and the rest of the world, increasing the 
competitive advantage of Chinese EV and battery producers. The faster pace of 
battery cost reduction and innovation in China has been enabled by fierce 
competition that has driven down profit margins for most producers (though not 
all), at the same time as driving up manufacturing efficiency and yields, as well as 
access to a large skilled workforce, and battery supply chain integration. 
Battery chemistry also plays an important role, with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) 
batteries – the main battery chemistry used in China – being almost 30% cheaper 
per kilowatt-hour (kWh) than lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NMC) 
batteries, which remain the most widely used batteries in the United States and 
Europe. NMC batteries still provide an energy density advantage, though the gap 
has narrowed in recent years. The energy density of LFP battery packs is about 
one-fifth lower by mass (Wh/kg) and about one-third lower by volume (Wh/L) than 
that of NMC packs. This is, however, partially offset by LFP’s ability to reach 100% 
state of charge when required without significant degradation, whereas NMC 
batteries are typically limited to 80% to preserve long-term performance.  
The higher energy density of NMC batteries remains an advantage for applications 
requiring longer ranges or operation in cold climates, where LFP technology is 
typically less effective. However, LFP batteries have now reached a performance 
level sufficient for most EV applications, making their lower cost a key advantage 
for automakers aiming to mass markets.

The battery price per kWh is also heavily dependent on the targeted application, 
with BEVs enabling the lowest costs. In 2024, battery pack prices per kWh for 
plug-in hybrid electric cars were more than three times those for battery electric 
cars, because of their smaller size and greater power requirements. In 2024, the 
average price of a 20 kWh PHEV battery pack – roughly the global sales-weighted 
average for standard plug-in hybrids – was about the same as a 65 kWh BEV 
battery pack, the global sales-weighted average for battery electric cars.  
Pack components such as the battery management system are common to BEV 
and PHEV battery packs, but given that PHEV packs are smaller, the price of such 
components is spread across fewer battery cells, increasing the price per kWh. 
PHEV battery packs may also require more complex designs to accommodate the 
internal combustion engine, which increases their production cost. Additionally, 
because of the smaller pack size, each battery cell in the PHEV pack has higher 
power requirements to guarantee minimum acceleration standards while driving 
in full electric mode. This demands different battery designs, such as thinner 
electrodes, to improve battery power at the expense of its energy density,1 further 
increasing the cost per kWh compared to BEVs. Smaller battery sizes also 
increase prices per kWh for 2/3W batteries. 
Battery specifics, however, only determine prices for high volume. For instance, in 
China, electric truck battery prices per kWh are slightly lower than for battery 
electric cars, thanks to their larger size and therefore the reduced contribution of 
the battery pack cost. Electric truck markets in other countries are far less mature, 
and their battery price per kWh remains significantly higher – in 2024, prices were 
more than double those in China.  
Lithium iron phosphate batteries continue to gain market share, 
and with them so do Chinese manufacturers 
In 2024, LFP batteries made up nearly half of the global EV battery market, 
underpinning the efforts of manufacturers to lower EV prices and production costs 
in order to maintain or gain market share in an increasingly competitive market. 
China leads on the uptake of LFP batteries, which met nearly three-quarters of its 
domestic battery demand in 2024, and their share shows no sign of slowing down, 
reaching 80% of batteries sold in November and December 2024. 
In the United States, the share of LFP batteries used in EVs slightly contracted in 
2024, remaining below 10%, which may be a result of tariffs on Chinese batteries. 
In contrast, in the European Union, LFP battery adoption grew by about 90% for 
 
 
1 “Energy density” is used here as a general term referring to the amount of energy stored per unit of mass or volume. It can 
be divided into two specific metrics: specific energy (Wh/kg) and energy density (Wh/L). Specific energy influences the 
additional weight the battery adds to the vehicle, thereby affecting its efficiency. Energy density determines the amount of 
energy that can be stored in a battery pack of a given size, typically defined by the vehicle's chassis dimensions and shape.

the second consecutive year to reach more than 10% of the EU EV market. 
Notably, nearly all the LFP batteries for electric cars sold in Europe or the 
United States were produced in China, which today has a de facto monopoly on 
this type of battery. Market penetration of LFP batteries is moving even faster in 
other markets. In Southeast Asia, Brazil and India, the share of electric car 
batteries using LFP reached more than 50% in 2024. In Southeast Asia and Brazil, 
LFP uptake is led by imports from China, mostly by BYD, whereas in India it is 
driven by cars produced domestically, led by Tata Motors. 
In the United States, the vast majority (three-quarters) of EVs equipped with LFP 
batteries are produced domestically, whereas in the European Union nearly two-
thirds are imported from China. In both regions, LFP batteries are primarily 
sourced from China, with Tesla playing a central role – accounting for 85% of LFP 
battery-powered EVs produced in the United States and almost half of those sold 
in the European Union. Of Tesla’s LFP EVs sold in the European Union, over half 
are produced in Germany, with the remainder imported from China.

European OEMs are looking increasingly favourably on LFP batteries as a way of 
reducing production costs and are therefore interested in securing more supplies.

therefore help the European automotive industry to reduce costs and increase its 
competitiveness in the coming years. However, investments in LFP battery 
manufacturing in Europe might suffer as a result of the recent proposition from the 
Chinese government to limit exports of key battery technologies, including LFP 
cathode production and lithium processing. Overall, renewed interest in the LFP 
chemistry exacerbates the difficulties facing the European battery industry, which 
has historically focused on NMC batteries. 
The year 2024 was a challenging one for the European battery industry, with both 
small and large producers suffering for different reasons. New players such as 
Northvolt, which filed for bankruptcy in the United States and Sweden, faced 
serious difficulties in scaling up production, leading to insufficient manufacturing 
yield and high production costs. The case of Northvolt was further aggravated by 
limited experience, ambitious expansion plans, and excessively widened scope, 
leading to insufficient focus on scaling up high-quality battery cell production. 
Falling battery prices worldwide also weighed heavily on small producers, which 
have fewer resources and insufficient production volumes to withstand lower profit 
margins, and are now turning to a more cautious growth path.  
Korean companies, such as LG Energy Solution in Poland, are the largest battery 
producers in Europe, but their market share is also under pressure. Over the past 
2 years, the market share of Korean manufacturers in the European Union has 
fallen from nearly 80% in 2022 to 60% in 2024, to the benefit of Chinese 
manufacturers. A key reason for this is the increased success of the LFP 
chemistry. In contrast, the share of Korean companies in the United States grew 
from about 20% in 2022 to over 35% in 2024, at the expense of Japanese 
manufacturers. 
Korean manufacturers are rising to the challenge and are now investing in LFP, 
including through innovation efforts, and are scaling up LFP battery production, 
including in Europe and the United States. LFP battery development is also 
advancing in Japan: In early 2025, Nissan announced plans to build an LFP 
battery plant after receiving government certification in late 2024. Yet Chinese 
manufacturers are continuing to innovate LFP chemistry and performance 
simultaneously, further raising the bar for other producers. At the same time, the 
Chinese government’s proposed export restrictions on advanced LFP 
technologies could limit technology transfer.  
In the United States, Panasonic – historically Tesla’s main battery partner – 
remained the country’s largest battery producer in 2024, accounting for nearly half 
of the electric car market. However, its share is declining as Korean producers like 
LG Energy Solution, Samsung and SKI invest heavily in the US market. Tesla also 
ramped up its own battery production in 2024, primarily for use in the Cybertruck.

Battery production in the United States is expanding rapidly, spurred by the 
implementation of tax credits. Manufacturing capacity has doubled since 2022, 
reaching more than 200 GWh in 2024, with nearly 700 GWh of additional capacity 
under construction. Around 40% of existing and committed capacity is being 
operated or developed by established battery makers in close collaboration with 
automakers. Nevertheless, the cost of production remains higher than in Asia, if 
not accounting for incentives, and sudden policy shifts could affect the emerging 
US battery industry, increase production costs, or slow expansion in the near to 
medium term.

Battery innovation is accelerating, and it is not limited to 
new chemistries 
Advanced battery technologies under development include solid-state, sodium-
ion, lithium-sulphur, iron-air, and redox-flow batteries, among others. Some of 
them, like iron-air and redox-flow batteries, target different applications to 
established lithium-ion technologies, such as longer-duration storage for grid 
applications. Others, like sodium-ion batteries, aim to reduce dependence on 
lithium. Lastly, technologies like solid-state and lithium-sulphur batteries could 
also accelerate electrification in sectors that require or would benefit from higher 
energy densities, such as long-haul electric trucks or short-haul boats and planes. 
However, their deployment in these sectors will depend on meeting stringent 
safety requirements and on their total cost of ownership.

Sodium-ion batteries gained significant attention in 2022 as lithium prices 
surged, leading to the first EVs using the technology. Despite enthusiasm waxing 
and waning as a result of material supply chain challenges and falling lithium 
prices in 2023 and 2024, CATL – the world’s largest battery producer – announced 
its second generation of sodium-ion batteries in 2025, alongside the launch of a 
dedicated sodium-ion battery brand. Meanwhile, BYD is also investing in sodium-
ion battery production for EVs and battery storage. In March 2025, HiNa launched 
its new sodium-ion battery, which offers improved energy density and faster 
charging compared to the previous generation, heralding a promising year for this 
technology. However, recent analyses indicate that sodium-ion batteries will 
require either increased energy density or more favourable operating conditions – 
particularly higher lithium prices – to compete with LFP batteries on a price per 
kWh basis. Nevertheless, sodium-ion technologies could play a significant role 
during times of elevated lithium prices and may offer a cheaper option for batteries 
in cold climates, where LFP batteries typically perform less well. 
In 2024, solid-state batteries moved closer to commercial reality with new large 
prototypes and manufacturing investments from Samsung SDI, Toyota, NIO, 
Honda, Quantum Scape, BASQUEVOLT, and Factorial, among others, and the 
creation of a government-led Chinese battery alliance, including large producers 
such as CATL, BYD, SAIC and Geely, to accelerate solid-state battery 
development. Despite this, their potential advantages, including enabling higher 
ranges and safety, still need to be demonstrated for battery packs manufactured 
at scale and tested under controlled, realistic and standardised conditions. The 
technology readiness level (TRL) of solid-state batteries therefore remains at large 
pilot stage (TRL 6), although this could change rapidly with companies like Toyota 
and BYD planning first mass production by 2027-2028. However, volumes will be 
limited initially, and it will take several years following roll-out for solid-state 
batteries to eventually become competitive with lithium-ion batteries. Additionally, 
“solid-state batteries” is often used as a generic term covering a range of options 
between fully solid-state and incumbent lithium-ion batteries, which creates some 
confusion. The first “solid-state batteries” to be commercialised might be semi- or 
quasi-solid-state batteries – for example using gel-like electrolyte2 or incorporating 
small volumes of liquid electrolytes – as they could help address some scale-up 
challenges and reduce production costs.  
Lithium-sulphur (Li-S) batteries, promising higher specific energy (Wh/kg) and 
lower reliance on critical minerals, have also gained momentum. The US start-up 
Lyten announced the world’s first Li-S gigafactory, while Stellantis partnered with 
Zeta to commercialise this technology by 2030. However, several challenges 
remain, including improving volumetric energy density (Wh/L), enhancing

durability, and addressing safety concerns related to the use of lithium metal 
anodes. Overcoming these hurdles will be key to enabling real-world applications.  
Advances in battery recycling are also being made, for example combining 
pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy processes, increasing the recovery efficiency 
of reactive metals such as lithium, recycling the graphite in the anodes, or through 
the development of new recycling approaches, such as electrochemical 
extraction. However, recycling feedstock availability remains limited, restricting the 
impact of recycling in the short term (see Box below).  
Options for battery reuse at the end of their first life for less demanding 
applications are also under development, with the majority of companies in the 
sector based in Europe. However, the economic viability of reuse is complicated 
by upstream competition from recyclers looking for access to end-of-life batteries, 
downstream competition from the falling prices of new batteries, and challenges 
associated with battery dismantling and repurposing while ensuring strict safety 
standards. Second-hand EV markets may play a larger role in supporting reuse 
and also increasing affordability. 
Innovation extends far beyond battery chemistries, and the already broad 
landscape of battery innovation is getting even broader.3 In 2023 and 2024, there 
was a remarkable surge in improvements for incumbent lithium-ion batteries, 
from superfast charging and “no-degradation” batteries to ultra-energy-dense 
batteries and new charging platforms, manufacturing processes, cell formats and 
pack designs, among others. Advances in manufacturing are also notable: for 
example, artificial intelligence for image analysis can enable the early detection of 
battery defects and their root causes, thereby improving production yields and 
reducing scrap rates. This capability is critical for scaling up production given the 
pace of modern gigafactories – a 50 GWh facility can produce up to 10 million 
(cylindrical) or hundreds of thousands (prismatic) EV battery cells per day.4 The 
nature and pace of innovations in legacy technologies are already making a big 
impact on the market, posing a formidable challenge for emerging technologies to 
compete.

Battery recycling is important, but its benefits will take time to materialise  
Battery recycling is crucial for the battery industry’s long-term sustainability, and is 
being promoted by industry organisations and governments through dedicated 
investments and regulations. For instance, the EU Batteries Regulation sets 
requirements for minimum recycling efficiency and recycled contents that will 
increase progressively. Recycled battery metals such as nickel, cobalt and lithium 
can incur 80% less GHG emissions than primary materials produced from mining and 
refining, while also reducing local environmental impacts, including water use and 
biodiversity loss near mines. 
In addition to sustainability, governments are prioritising supply chain security. 
Recycling can enhance resilience for consumer countries without direct access to 
battery minerals, but only if there is a simultaneous development of the midstream 
battery supply chain, particularly the cathode active material (CAM) industry. To 
realise the security benefits, end-of-life batteries must be recycled, and the recovered 
minerals processed and utilised domestically, or in a partner country, to produce 
CAMs for batteries. However, the CAM industry is progressing more slowly than the 
battery industry in Europe and the United States. In the absence of a domestic 
industry, the recycled minerals would need to be exported for processing and then 
reimported as CAMs, or within batteries or EVs, thereby forfeiting the supply chain 
security advantage.  
Recycling industries in Europe and North America have focused on NMC batteries – 
the main chemistry used for electric cars in these regions, but advances in LFP 
batteries are now making them more attractive outside of China, where LFP already 
leads the EV battery market. The rise of cheaper batteries such as LFP poses a 
challenge to the economic viability of battery recycling, which requires sufficiently high 
concentrations of valuable minerals in batteries to be profitable. Nevertheless, this 
does not preclude LFP battery recyclability, and NMC recycling facilities can be 
modified to process LFP batteries, though this might require different business 
models. Toll-based models – through the implementation of gate fees – can ensure 
the economic viability of LFP recycling, especially when lithium prices are low. 
Regulations would need to define how these toll fees are distributed to guarantee the 
proper management of all end-of-life batteries. 
It will take time for the battery recycling industry to significantly affect primary mineral 
demand, as feedstock remains limited and EV batteries may last longer than 
previously expected. End-of-life EV and storage batteries are expected to account for 
only one-third of recyclable feedstock by 2030 and even less in the interim, with 
manufacturing scraps making up the rest. It will require about a decade for end-of-life 
batteries to become the main feedstock. In 2035, if countries fulfil their announced 
climate pledges, recycling would reduce global primary demand for cobalt by over 
15% (40% in 2050), and for lithium and nickel by only about 5% (25% in 2050).

Battery production and trade 
The battery market is being reshaped by two distinct trends: increasing 
consolidation, and government-led efforts to geographically diversify battery 
supply chains. Whereas markets used to be regionalised and small, they are now 
global and very large, and uncertainty over technological development is giving 
way to standardisation. In this new phase, economies of scale, partnerships along 
the supply chain, manufacturing efficiency, and the capacity to bring innovations 
swiftly to market will be even more crucial for manufacturers to remain competitive.  
The battery supply chain remains geographically 
concentrated 
The EV and battery supply chain becomes increasingly geographically 
concentrated when moving upstream from car manufacturing to battery cell and 
component production. China was responsible for 80% of global battery cell 
production in 2024, while the remainder was produced in the United States, the 
European Union, Korea and Japan. Importantly, the production of lithium-ion 
battery manufacturing equipment is also highly concentrated, with China, Korea, 
and Japan leading the market. China has also established a near monopoly on 
battery components production, supplying almost 85% of cathode active materials 
– including NMC and LFP chemistries – and over 90% of anode active material 
production, predominantly graphite. Outside of China, only Korea and Japan offer 
sizeable production capacity for cathode components. Korea also produces 
anodes, and Indonesia is expected to bring some diversification to the market. 
Nonetheless, China is set to remain the largest producer of batteries and their 
components by some distance in the medium term, based on announced projects 
and competitive advantages. 
The geographical concentration of battery mineral mining and refining needed for 
battery cathodes and anodes is also a concern. In 2023, Australia, Chile and China 
mined about 85% of global lithium, with almost 65% refined in China and another 
25% in Chile. Indonesia accounted for over half of nickel mining in 2023, while 
China and Indonesia together refined more than 60%. In the same year, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo was home to almost two-thirds of the world’s cobalt 
mining, though three-quarters of all cobalt refining was handled in China. Graphite 
supply, the only critical mineral used for anodes today, is even more concentrated, 
with China responsible for 80% of mining and over 90% of refining.

Battery manufacturing capacity continues to grow 
Global battery (cell) manufacturing capacity grew almost 30% in 2024 to reach 
more than 3 TWh – three times EV and battery storage demand in the same year. 
About 85% of global manufacturing capacity is in China, showing little change from 
2023, and over 75% is owned by Chinese producers. Manufacturing capacity in 
the United States grew by almost 50%, led by Korean companies attracted by tax 
credits, which accounted for nearly 70% of the growth in 2024. This led installed 
capacity in the United States to surpass that in the European Union, which 
nonetheless increased by 10% in 2024 despite the Northvolt plant in Sweden 
being halted following its bankruptcy. The first Indian and Indonesian battery 
plants also opened in 2024, totalling more than 5 GWh/year and 10 GWh/year of 
manufacturing capacity, respectively. 
Korean manufacturers remained the largest investors in overseas battery 
manufacturing capacity, 5 accounting for over 400 GWh globally, compared to 
60 GWh for Japanese and 30 GWh for Chinese producers. Korean

Samsung and SKI (in Hungary), continue to be the main source of capacity in the

more than the announced overseas manufacturing capacity of Chinese battery 
producers.

Asian manufacturers are leading battery market expansion 
Expansion plans for manufacturing capacity can drive geographical diversification 
in the battery industry. Committed projects – i.e. those that are either under 
construction or have reached a final investment decision – would increase 
manufacturing capacity in China by nearly 60%, and almost quadruple capacity in 
the European Union and the United States. This expansion would lead global 
manufacturing capacity to grow to about 6.5 TWh (and more than 9 TWh if 
accounting for all announcements), up from 3.3 TWh in 2024, and reduce China’s 
share of global manufacturing capacity to about two-thirds by 2030, down from 
85% in 2024. Ownership distribution is expected to diversify less, given that 
capacity expansion is predominantly driven by established manufacturers 
headquartered in China, Korea or Japan, whose expertise in the battery sector 
provides a significant competitive edge.

Historical production and announced expansion of battery manufacturing maximum 
output by region, 2023, 2024 and 2030 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Notes: Increased utilisation refers to the gap between 2023 production levels and existing capacity being utilised at 85%, 
which is assumed to be the maximum average utilisation rate. A utilisation rate of 85% is also used for both committed and 
preliminary manufacturing capacity in 2030. Manufacturing capacity refers to companies already certified to serve both the 
EV and stationary storage markets and companies not yet certified to serve the EV market. Committed refers to plants that 
have reached a final investment decision and are starting or have already started construction works, and preliminary to 
plants that have been announced but are not yet being built. Production refers to EV battery and battery storage, and EV 
and battery stockpiling are excluded from the analysis. Data to end of Q1 2025.  
Sources: IEA analysis based on data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, Bloomberg New Energy Finance, and EV 
Volumes. 
 
The European Union is the largest single destination for overseas investments by 
Chinese battery producers, whose share of manufacturing capacity in the region 
could quadruple, rising from less than 10% in 2024 to more than 30% by 2030. 
These investments are an opportunity for technology transfer, bringing the 
expertise needed to scale up production in the region and drive down costs, which 
would benefit domestic automakers at a critical time for the industry. However, this 
may also create challenges for the region’s established and emerging battery 
producers.  
The share of battery manufacturing capacity in the European Union owned by 
Korean producers is expected to fall sharply from about 85% in 2024 to nearly 30% 
in 2030, while the share of EU-based companies could reach 20%, up from 5% at 
the end of 2024. However, this includes plants facing significant uncertainty, such 
as the Northvolt plant in Germany, for which Germany assumed over 
EUR 600 million in debt, and which is not directly affected Northvolt’s bankruptcy. 
More generally, concerns are growing about the ability of smaller European 
producers to scale up production and compete with established global players, 
which may lead to a much smaller share of the future EU battery market being 
captured by domestic manufacturers.

Share of nameplate manufacturing capacity by region and location of battery 
producer’s headquarters, 2024-2030 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Notes: Committed refers to the sum of the installed manufacturing capacity (2024) and plants that have reached a final 
investment decision and are starting or have already started construction works. Manufacturing capacity refers to battery 
cells. For companies headquartered in a country but owned by companies headquartered in a second country, the 
headquarters of the owning company is considered for this analysis. The manufacturing capacity of joint ventures between 
automakers and battery producers is classified according to the battery producer headquarters. Numbers above each bar 
indicate the total nameplate manufacturing capacity in terawatt-hours (TWh) of batteries per year. Data to end of Q1 2025. 
Sources: IEA analysis based on data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence and Bloomberg New Energy Finance. 
 
Collaboration between Korean or Japanese battery producers and OEMs 
operating in the United States is proving successful, with Korean companies 
leading investments in the country. They held or participated in 40% of the battery 
manufacturing capacity in the United States in 2024, and committed investments 
are expected to boost their share to over 50% by 2030. Meanwhile, based on 
committed projects, the share of Japanese companies would fall by almost half by 
2030, and that of domestic companies like Tesla would drop from nearly 40% in 
2024 to less than 30% in 2030. In addition, some companies primarily or fully 
owned by Chinese groups, such as Envision and Gotion, have also invested or 
announced plans to invest in the United States, but recent policies might lead to 
the cancellation of these plans. 
Outside of today’s three main EV markets, 60% of committed capacity is set to be 
added in other advanced economies thanks to growing demand and government 
support, including in Canada, other European countries, Korea, and Japan. The 
remaining more than 150 GWh of committed manufacturing capacity is being built 
in Southeast Asia, India and Morocco. Although these regions have attracted 
fewer investments to date due to limited domestic battery demand, they are 
increasingly generating interest from battery manufacturers.

Southeast Asia is attracting significant Chinese investments, which could speed 
up technology and innovation transfer. Indonesia, home to half the world’s mined 
nickel needed for NMC batteries, is also investing heavily in battery component 
production – such as cathode and anode active materials – and its first graphite 
anode plants began production in 2024. India also has the potential to unlock a 
substantial battery market and is investing in domestic battery production, but 
realising its ambition to become a major battery manufacturer will require 
additional investments and clear policy signals supporting EV demand. In 
Morocco, abundant phosphate reserves – a mineral essential for LFP batteries – 
along with an established car manufacturing industry and free trade agreements 
with the European Union and the United States, have spurred over USD 15 billion 
in announced investments. These investments comprise lithium processing and 
battery and component manufacturing, including a large battery manufacturing 
plant of 100 GWh, the first in Africa.

8. Outlook for energy demand 
Electricity demand 
Electric vehicles could account for more than 4% of 
European electricity demand by 2030 
In 2024, the global fleet of EVs consumed around 180 TWh of electricity,1 almost 
60% more than the previous year. To put this in perspective, 180 TWh is more 
than the annual electricity consumption of Argentina. At the global level, EVs 
represented about 0.7% of final electricity consumption in 2024. 
The stock of EVs is set to more than triple to 2030, but electricity demand could 
increase more than fourfold, reaching 780 TWh in the STEPS. This is driven by 
increasing consumption from electric trucks, as well as greater EV uptake in 
markets where people drive more per year. Total energy demand for road 
transport increases by only 5% in 2030 in the STEPS, while total road activity (in 
terms of vehicle kilometres travelled) increases by almost 20% during the same 
period, reflecting the greater energy efficiency of EVs.

Globally, electric LDVs remain the greatest consumer of electricity for road 
transport, though their share of road electricity demand falls by around 
5 percentage points in 2024 to slightly above 60% in 2030 in the STEPS. In China 
in 2024, LDVs were responsible for only around 55% of road electricity demand, 
and this remains the same in 2030 in the STEPS, illustrating China’s success in 
EV adoption across a range of applications. In contrast, over 90% of electricity 
demand for road in the United States came from electric cars in 2024, though this 
falls to around 75% in 2030 in the STEPS, as demand from electric buses and 
commercial vehicles picks up. In Europe, the increasing number of electric heavy-
duty trucks means their share of road transport electricity demand increases from 
less than 5% to more than 20% in 2030 in the STEPS.  
In both China and Europe, the share of electricity demand from EVs reached the 
milestone of 1% in 2024. By 2030 in the STEPS, the share of electricity for EVs in 
Europe exceeds the share in China, as electricity demand for other end uses, such 
as industry and buildings, grows faster in China than in Europe. Globally, EVs 
represent 2.5% of electricity demand in 2030 in the STEPS.

Oil displacement 
Electric vehicles displace more than 5 mb/d by 2030 
Expanding EV adoption continues to reduce oil demand, with oil displacement 
growing by 30% to over 1.3 mb/d in 2024 – equivalent to Japan’s entire transport 
sector oil demand today. By the end of the decade, EVs are set to displace over 
5 mb/d of diesel and gasoline in the STEPS, and China’s EVs to account for half 
of displaced oil. 


Global EV Outlook 2025 
Outlook for energy demand 
PAGE | 154  
Electric LDVs drive most of the oil displacement, accounting for 80% today and 
around 77% by 2030. The relative impact of LDVs becomes smaller over time as 
technology developments and the expansion of charging infrastructure drive 
electrification in the heavy-duty segment, with electric trucks and buses together 
displacing nearly 1 mb/d in the STEPS by 2030. 
Oil displacement by region and mode in the Stated Policies Scenario, 2024-2030 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Notes: Oil displacement is based on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle fuel consumption to cover the same mileage 
as the electric vehicle (EV) fleet. Oil displacement is calculated by assuming that the distance (total kilometres) travelled by 
EVs by segment each year would have been otherwise travelled by ICE vehicles or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). In the 
case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), where the powertrain uses both oil-based fuel and electricity, only the 
distance covered by electricity is included. This method of estimation assumes that EVs replace ICE or hybrid vehicles of 
the same segment, and that these vehicles follow the same driving behaviour. The accuracy of this assumption is 
uncertain; there is some evidence to suggest that EVs are driven further than their ICE counterparts, for example. 
 
Governments will need to adapt tax policies to ensure 
both future revenues and growth of electrification  
One of the primary financial challenges of vehicle electrification for governments 
is the resulting reduction in revenue from fossil fuel taxes. While efficiency 
improvements in ICEs have already had an impact on tax receipts, the fuel shift 
could lead to a further decline in tax income. Although EV drivers contribute to 
additional revenue through electricity taxes, this remains insufficient to fully 
compensate for the loss in gasoline and diesel tax income.  
In 2024, electricity tax revenue increased by nearly 50% to reach more than 
USD 2.5 billion globally, while gasoline and diesel tax revenues accounted for 
USD 560 billion. As the global EV stock continues to rise, fossil fuel tax revenue 
is projected to decrease significantly to nearly USD 520 billion by 2030 in the 
STEPS, while electricity tax revenue grows to over USD 10 billion. If the decline 
in fossil fuel tax revenue is not compensated with alternative taxation measures, 
the effect of electrification displacing gasoline and diesel would result in a net tax

shortfall for governments reaching more than USD 65 billion globally by 2030. In 
this scenario, Europe would account for 55% of net tax shortfall if no changes are 
made to fuel taxation.  
China’s fossil fuel tax revenues are projected to decrease from USD 45 billion to 
USD 41 billion as the share of electric cars in the total fleet rises to around 35% 
by 2030 in the STEPS. However, the increase in China’s electricity tax revenue 
due to vehicle fleet electrification would nearly fully offset the loss. In Europe, 
which sees the largest decrease in fossil fuel tax revenue, the net impact of 
electrification is expected to result in a tax revenue decline of USD 40 billion in the 
STEPS by 2030. In the United States, fossil fuel tax revenue is projected to 
increase by USD 0.1 billion due to slow electrification and growth in the overall 
vehicle fleet. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is set to experience an increase in 
combined fossil fuel and electricity tax revenue totalling around USD 6.5 billion by 
the end of the decade, driven by expected growth in both ICEs and EVs.

Tax reforms to address tax income loss due to rising electromobility have tended 
to target three main areas: energy use (e.g. fuel excise duty), vehicle stock (e.g. 
registration tax) or road use (e.g. road tolls). For example, New Zealand ended its 
exemption for EVs from road use charges in 2024, and its new rate of 
NZD 76 (New Zealand dollars) (USD 46) per 1 000 km for BEVs is estimated to 
have generated tax revenue in the order of USD 50 million in 2024. To stabilise 
tax revenues, Norway, a world leader on electromobility, with nearly 90% share of 
car sales being battery electric in 2024, introduced a vehicle weight tax of 
NOK 12.08 Norwegian kroner (USD 1.1) per kilogramme on BEVs, generating

around USD 0.15 billion in 2024. Prior to this, in 2023, Norway introduced a 25% 
VAT rate on BEVs priced at more than NOK 500 000 (around USD 46 000), and 
estimates having earned around  (USD 0.14 billion) in 2024 from this new VAT tax 
measure. However, maintaining the VAT exemption for battery electric cars priced 
below NOK 500 000 resulted in revenue loss of around NOK 13 billion 
(USD 1.2 billion).  
Prior to 2025, the United Kingdom waived vehicle excise duty (VED) for electric, 
zero, or low-emission cars, vans and motorcycles. From 1 April 2025, however, 
new electric cars are taxed GBP 10 (USD 13) in the first year and the standard 
rate, GBP 195 (around USD 255), in subsequent years. This measure boosts 
government coffers by nearly USD 3 billion by 2030 in the STEPS. Considering 
the gain from EV VED alongside the reduction in VED from ICE vehicles, the net 
tax increase from total car VED is projected to reach more than USD 1 billion by 
2030.  
Another option open to policy makers could be taxing vehicles based on efficiency, 
rather than imposing a flat rate, which would mean owners of less efficient, older 
vehicles bear a higher tax burden. While this could further incentivise EV growth, 
it might disproportionally affect people in lower-income demographics who are 
more likely to own an older vehicle, potentially reducing the public acceptance of 
electromobility in the long-term.  
Similarly, there is a risk of public pushback in response to the introduction of taxes 
on EVs to cover fuel excise duty losses. To minimise this risk, any tax reform will 
need to be designed in a way that protects low-income households, while avoiding 
penalising early EV adopters. As the shift towards EVs continues, it will be 
essential for governments to introduce tax measures that gradually address the 
revenue gap while continuing to incentivise a just transition to a low-emissions 
transport system.

Notes: Estimates are for a United States class 8 (or equivalent) tractor-trailer. The weight of the diesel battery is included in 
powertrain. Battery electric trucks are assumed to use lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and fuel cell electric trucks lithium 
nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NMC); in 2024 and 2030 these are assumed to have energy densities of 190 Wh/kg and 
230 Wh/kg, and 250 Wh/kg and 280 Wh/kg. All values are rounded to the nearest 100 kg. 
Sources: Values for the specific mass of diesel trucks, hydrogen tanks, fuel cells, powertrain or motors, and trailers come 
from the ICCT, and were validated against assumptions from Riccardo.

Notes: “BEV” = battery electric vehicle; “FCEV” = fuel cell electric vehicle. Payloads are calculated as the maximum gross 
vehicle weight, minus the estimated unladen weights from the previous table, plus the derogation, if applicable. The US 
maximum gross vehicle weight is set to the 80 000 lb (36 288 kg) limit and does not include allowances for different 
configurations, the derogations refers to the 2 000 lb (907 kg) additional allowance for natural gas and electric vehicles but 
is assumed to also apply to FCEVs as per amendments made to several state laws. The proposed 4 000 kg (additional 
2 000 kg on top of existing derogation) in the European Union is not included in the table but would reduce the penalty 
relative to diesel in 2024 to 2.6% and -0.8%, and in 2030 to -0.2% and -2.4% for BEV and FCEV respectively, with negative 
values implying they would, in theory, be permitted to run at a greater gross vehicle weight than their diesel counterparts. 
No derogation currently applies or is proposed for China.

Notes: CAPEX = Capital expenditure and includes installation cost. OPEX = Operating expenditure, which is an annual 
cost expressed as a share of CAPEX. Utilisation factor refers to the share of hours in a day during which the charger is 
occupied. It is assumed that each battery electric vehicle requires the installation of one 50 kW charger at the depot, with a 
15-year lifetime and 8% discount rate, and no additional land costs. For each year of operation one year of levelised cost of 
the depot charger is added to the infrastructure costs of the battery electric truck. For the 350 kW charger, vehicle footprint 
including 10% setback is assumed to be 54m2 plus 20m2 per charging pile for the pile itself, cabling, or other equipment. 
Industrial land values for the United States and Europe are assumed to be USD 1 642/m2 and USD 242/m2 in China and 
include a 23% markup for permitting and preparation. 350 kW charger costs are levelised assuming a 10-year lifetime and 
8% discount rate. Diesel refuelling station infrastructure cost of 2% of the sale price of the fuel assumed throughout to 
account for both capital and operating costs. 
Sources: The estimate for additional area required per charging pile is adapted from the ICCT, permitting and preparation 
costs associated with land purchase are taken from Argonne National Laboratory, industrial land values are adapted from 
CommercialEdge (United States and Europe) and CEIC (China).

Notes: CAPEX = Capital expenditure and includes installation cost; OPEX = Operating expenditure. “Fixed” is an annual 
cost expressed as a share of CAPEX, “Variable” is per unit of hydrogen dispensed. For a hydrogen refuelling station 
“utilisation factor” refers to the share of maximum daily hydrogen capacity which is dispensed each day. Hydrogen is 
delivered to the station and dispensed as a gas at 700 bar. Costs are levelised assuming a 10-year lifetime and 8% 
discount rate. A total station footprint of 1 759 m2 is assumed. Industrial land values for the United States and Europe are 
assumed to be USD 1 642/m2 and USD 242/m2 in China, and include a 23% markup for permitting and preparation. Diesel 
refuelling station infrastructure cost of 2% of the sale price of the fuel assumed throughout to account for both capital and 
operating costs. 
Sources: Station footprints, as well as permitting and preparation costs associated with land purchase, are taken from

Notes: BEV = Battery electric vehicle; EV = Electric Vehicle; FCEV = Fuel cell electric vehicle; HRS = Hydrogen Refuelling 
Station; UF = Utilisation Factor. The “high cost” case corresponds to the scenario where the total cost of ownership is 
expected to be the highest. The “payload penalty” is calculated in a previous table of this Annex. HRS fill rate and charging 
power impact the total cost of ownership via the “dwell costs”, which is the financial penalty incurred when refuelling takes 
longer than the minimum rest period. In the case of charging power the capital costs also vary.

Driving and refuelling profile 
The daily driving range is assumed to be 500 km, where half of the daily distance 
is travelled before the driver’s rest period and the other half afterwards. It is 
assumed that all truck types refuel during the rest periods. Regulations require 
rest periods durations of 20, 30, and 45 minutes in China, the United States, and 
the European Union, respectively. It is assumed that the diesel trucks can 
sufficiently refuel within the rest periods, and thus incur no dwell costs (see below 
for how dwell costs are calculated for battery electric and fuel cell electric trucks). 
En route charging is assumed to occur with 350 kW chargers. Battery electric 
trucks are also assumed to charge overnight, up to 10 hours, using a 50 kW (peak) 
charger. It is assumed that the trucks can operate seven days per week, forty-
eight weeks per year for a total of 168 000 km travelled per year.  
Dwell costs for battery electric trucks 
Maximum and minimum charge levels of 20% and 80% are maintained to preserve 
battery health and for enhanced safety. Battery electric trucks are assumed to 
charge for the full length of their rest period and during their stay in depot. If 
required, the battery electric truck remains charging after the rest period until the 
state of charge is sufficient to complete the remaining 250 km to return to depot, 
charge overnight at the depot, and then complete the 250 km required to reach 
the rest period the following day. This additional daily charging, if required, is 
multiplied by labour cost to give the dwell cost.  
Financing period and additional considerations 
The truck is purchased with a 100% loan at 5% interest. A discount rate of 8% is 
applied throughout. The analysis takes into account the first 5 years after the 
purchase of the truck, equivalent to a total distance travelled of 840 000 km. Diesel 
trucks have a residual value of 26% throughout, BEV and FCEV trucks are 
assumed to also have a 26% residual value when purchased in 2024 and 33% if 
purchased in 2030, after haven driven comparable distances over that period to 
those modelled in this analysis.
